**What should I be doing each week?**

The University has suggested we make course materials self-paced as much as possible to accommodate all students.  So, what do you need to do?  Work through the materials as I post them and communicate with your group members to ensure your going to meet the deadlines posted on the website.

**How do I write my technical report?**

These are still meant to be completed in groups, as originally planned.  You only need to turn in one per group.

Write your materials and methods in your reports on the techniques you completed before break.  Include the instrument tables for the techniques you completed before break.

For the techniques you didn't complete, just write a sentence indicating that the data were collected by Dr. Al Fischer at Western Carolina University.  This is similar to what you would do if you had your samples independently analyzed.

**Do I really have to redo my lab notebooks?!**

Some of you have asked if you really have to redo your lab notebooks that you already completed.  It's up to you.  You may choose to redo them entirely (if you felt you really struggled to put it together the first time, this is what I'd suggest).  If you don't want to redo it, you can just update the file references to use the data I sent you.  What matters most is that you use the data I sent you and not your original data.  This is to ensure things are consistent for the whole class for the remainder of the semester.

What I envisioned was that most of you would end up creating a new notebook with new a new data processing section, but that you could copy and paste your previous intro and conclusions.

You do not need to re-write your methods sections, except for the instrument tables and block diagrams where necessary.  I will only be grading your Title, Intro, instrument tables, block diagrams (if needed), Results and Data Processing, Conclusions, and References in your future lab notebooks.  That means I won't be looking for specifics on standard creation, lab technique, etc., in your methods, only the instrument tables and block diagrams, from here on out.

Make sure you turn in your notebook, your data files, and your analysis worksheets for these labs.

You will get credit for the notebooks you already turned in.

**What are these videos?  Do I have to watch them?**

You do not have to watch the videos, but it's strongly encouraged.  They are meant to guide you through the programming exercises.  If you run into coding issues, please check the video to see if it answers your question.   I've tried to create table of contents to help you find the relevant parts.
