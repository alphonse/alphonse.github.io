# Introduction

This assignment covers Chapters 4 and 5 of [*Analytical Chemistry 2.1*](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Analytical_Chemistry/Book%3A_Analytical_Chemistry_2.1_%28Harvey%29/05%3A_Standardizing_Analytical_Methods) by Harvey involving basic analytical chemistry terms, statistical analysis, and confidence intervals.

# Lower Limit of Detection

1. The first plot below of signal vs. time was acquired by measuring the baseline (blank) signal from an instrument under development.  It was acquired with a signal averaging time of 1 second (sampling rate = 1 Hz).  What is the minimum detectable signal level for this instrument?

    <!-- \vspace{2cm} -->

1. The second plot below shows data from the same instrument, but with a signal averaging time of 10 seconds (sampling rate = 0.1 Hz).  What is the minimum detectable signal in this case?

    <!-- \vspace{2cm} -->

1. What causes the difference observed when the averaging time changes?

# Limits of Quantitation

1. The attached calibration curve is for the same instrument described above.  What is the minimum *detectable* concentration?

    <!-- \vspace{2cm} -->

1. What faction of the detected signal is actually due solely to random noise and not true signal?

    <!-- \vspace{2cm} -->

1. What is the minimum *quantifiable* concentration?

    <!-- \vspace{2cm} -->

1. What is the maximum quantifiable concentration?

    <!-- \vspace{2cm} -->

1. What is the linear dynamic range (LDR) of the instrument?
