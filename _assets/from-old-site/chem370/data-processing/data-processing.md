If you experience trouble with R or RStudio, you can use it on VCAT (Virtual Apps link on my.wcu.edu).  You will need to download the notebook templates from [GitHub](https://github.com/dr-fischer/instRumental/tree/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates).

We will focus heavily on analytical data processing throughout the semester.  You will be expected to process your data using the programming language R.  Although this may feel like computer science to some, programmatic data analysis is becoming an increasingly important part of analytical chemistry. (Remember, analytical chemistry is what analytical chemists do!)

You will undoubtedly encounter many error messages while coding this semester.  You will have to find the cause of the error and fix it before moving on.  It's likely you will feel lost, underprepared, and frustrated.  To help with this, I encourage you to follow the tutorials below.  If you get stuck, take a look at the *How to Get Help* section below.

# Data Processing Tutorials

Video tutorials for R, RStudio, and data processing methods.

# How to Get Help

- **R help:** Type `?function_name()` into the R prompt to learn about a function. For example, `?plot()` will bring up the help for the `plot()` function.
- **MS Teams Discussion:** Post your question to the general discussion channel in MS Teams.  This will be visible by the whole class.  If you know the answer to someone else's question, please answer it!  If no one knows the answer I'll weigh in.  By posting your question on MS Teams you allow the whole class to benefit and help keep me from answering the same question many times over.
- **Stack Overflow:** The [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) discussion board.  Often you can find Stack Overflow discussions that answer your question by using you favorite search engine (e.g. Google).
- **Each Other:** Please help each other!  I encourage collaboration.  Note that collaboratively helping each other does NOT mean sharing code verbatim.  Help others understand concepts and methods rather than providing an answer.
- **Email Me:** I can often help solve the problem via [email](mailto:dfischer@wcu.edu).  To the best extent possible, please take the following steps so that I can answer your question in an effective and timely manner:
  - *Be specific*.  I can't do much if you say "my code isn't working".  As Stack Exchange states, 'It doesn't work' isn't descriptive enough to help people understand your problem. Instead...tell other readers [i.e. your instructor] what the exact wording of the error message is, and which line of code is producing it"

  - *Explain what you've tried.*  I expect that you attempt to troubleshoot before contacting me.  Try to figure out what's occurring.  Try to re-create the error as a [minimal, reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example).  As Stack Exchange suggests:  
  
    > The more code there is to go through, the less likely people can find your problem. Streamline your example in one of two ways:  
    > - Restart from scratch. Create a new program, adding in only what is needed to see the problem. Use simple, descriptive names for functions and variables – don’t copy the names you’re using in your existing code.  
    > - Divide and conquer. If you’re not sure what the source of the problem is, start removing code a bit at a time until the problem disappears – then add the last part back.  
    
    
  
  I usually start with the second option and use the prior as a last resort.
  
  Please *do* ask for help when needed.  Although I want you to gain experience troubleshooting, I do not want you to spend hours focused on finding a single typo or rewriting your code multiple times!
  
  - *Include screen shots*.  A screen shot of RStudio showing your code, the error message, and your data is usually sufficient for me to understand what's going on.  If I need more information I'll ask you to send your code.
