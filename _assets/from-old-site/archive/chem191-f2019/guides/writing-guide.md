### Writing guidelines (based on common mistakes):

- Revise, revise, revise!  No writing is ever perfect the first time through; write, read, and revise!

- Make your report thorough yet concise.

- Be specific.

     - *Bad:* Samples were ~~heated~~ in an oven overnight.
     - *Good:* Samples were placed in an **80°C oven for 8 hours**.

- Avoid unnecessary words and phrases.

     - *Bad:* ~~It has been reported that~~ air pollution 7 million deaths per year.
     - *Good:* Air pollution causes 7 million deaths per year [Ref 1].

- Avoid too many/uncommon abbreviations, and define abbreviations the first time used (with a few exceptions, below); abbreviations should be appropriate for your audience.

     - *Abbreviations that do not need to be defined:* Element names (Cu) and well-known units (m, ml, °C, K, etc.)
     - *Good abbreviations, when defined:* Instrumental techniques, certain chemicals that are more commonly/easily known by their abbreviation (e.g. 4-MP).
     - *Bad abbreviations:* Tylenol (T-ol), acetaminophen (AM)

- Use first-person active voice.

     - *Bad:* ~~A GC-MS was used to perform a scent analysis on garlic.  Samples were prepared for analysis thusly:  To a sample vial, 1 g of garlic was chopped and added.~~
     - *Good:* We analyzed the scent of garlic using GC-MS.  We chopped 1 g of garlic and placed it in a sample vial for analysis.

- Use past tense for observations and methods.

     - *Bad:* Tylenol-brand tablets ~~contain~~ 5% less acetaminophen than advertised.
     - *Good:* Tylenol-brand tablets **contained** 5% less acetaminophen than advertised.

- Use present tense for accepted facts.

     - *Bad:* Tylenol ~~helped~~ relieve headaches.
     - *Good:* Tylenol **helps** relieve headaches.

- Avoid faulty or incomplete comparisons.

     - *Bad:* These ~~results~~ are similar to ~~previous studies~~.
     - *Good:* These **results** are similar to the **results of** previous studies
     - *Bad:* ~~Fractional distillation worked better.~~
     - *Good:* **Fractional distillation** worked better **than simple distillation**.

<!-- - Use the correct suffix: The suffixes *-graphy* or *-metry* typically indicate *techniques*; *-er* and *-ist* indicate *people*; *-ometer* and *-graph* typically *instruments*; and *-um* and *-am* indicate *data*.

     - *Bad:* ~~The~~ gas chromatography was used to analyze the samples.
     - *Good:* Gas chromatography was used to analyze the samples.
     - *Bad:* The ~~chromatograph~~ has two peaks.
     - *Good:* The **chromatogram** has two peaks. -->

- Use correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation.  See *Elements of Styles* ([Strunk and White](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37134?msg=welcome_stranger)) for more detail.

- Species names and Latin words are written in italic (e.g. *Allium sativum*, *in-vivo*).
