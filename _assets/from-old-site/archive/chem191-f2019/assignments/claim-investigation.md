# Scientific Claim Investigation

### Instructions

- Review your list of 10 scientific claims from earlier in the semester.

- Choose one claim to investigate in more detail.

- **Turn in a 1- to 2-paragraph summary of your claim.**  Elaborate a little more on the perceived basis for the claim and whether or not you think it's valid.  See if you can find the same (or a very similar) claim from other sources and include those in the summary.  Make sure you list the sources you find for the claims in a way that you could find them again.  Remember to include a title block on your assignment.
