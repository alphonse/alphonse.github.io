## Academic Integrity

You may use your textbooks, class notes, and any scholarly sources you find through the library to complete this assignment.  You are also highly encouraged to use spelling and grammar checkers.

You may NOT consult with classmates or any other individual (including students outside CHEM 191, faculty, tutors, etc.) about the exam!  By turning in your exam you expressly confirm that the examination is wholly your own work and you have only used the sources allowed above.  Plagiarism and dishonesty will NOT be tolerated. Any student not adhering to the rules outlined here or in further violation of the WCU's Academic Integrity Policy will be given a 0 for the midterm.  The Academic Integrity Policy is outlined in the Syllabus and quoted below for reference.

> **Academic Integrity Policy and Reporting Process:** This policy addresses academic integrity violations of undergraduate and graduate students. Students, faculty, staff, and administrators of Western Carolina University strive to achieve the highest standards of scholarship and integrity. Any violation of the Academic Integrity Pålicy is a serious offense because it threatens the quality of scholarship and undermines the integrity of the community. While academic in scope, any violation of this policy is by nature, a violation of the Code of Student Conduct and will follow the same conduct process (see ArticleVII.B.1.a.). If the charge occurs close to the end of an academic semester or term or in the event of the reasonable need of either party for additional time to gather information timelines may be extended at the discretion of the Department of Student Community Ethics (DSCE).
