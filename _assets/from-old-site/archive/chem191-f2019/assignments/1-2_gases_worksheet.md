1. The mixing ratio of ozone at ground level is usually about 20 ppb.  Express this as a partial pressure of ozone with respect to the atmosphere as a whole.



<!-- 1. Calculate the number concentration (number density) of air molecules in the atmosphere at STP.

1. When p = 1013 hPa and T = 288 K, what is the density of dry air?

1. What altitude corresponds to a pressure of 1 hPa? -->
