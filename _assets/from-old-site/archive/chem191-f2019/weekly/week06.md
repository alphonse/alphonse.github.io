# Monday

We will discuss atmospheric particulate matter.  Please read p. 101-110 in *APGW* to prepare for class.

The Coulter Faculty Commons will conduct a course audit to help me improve my teaching.  I will lecture for approximately half of the class while they observe.  I will then leave the room and you all will be provided with a chance to give the CFC representative honest criticisms of my teaching and the class.

# Wednesday

We will assemble the air quality sensors.

### To do:

- Your [Claim Investigation](https://alphonse.github.io/archive/chem191-f2019/assignments/claim-investigation) is due on Monday, September 23 at 23:59:59.
- Watch the soldering videos in [Exercise 5](https://archive/chem191-f2019.github.io/workbook/soldering-and-pcb-assembly.html) of the Teensy Workbook.
