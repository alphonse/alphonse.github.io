# SLO 1

***Demonstrate an ability to perform routine upkeep of scientific instrumentation and/or ability to train others on the use of chemical instrumentation.***

### HPLC

1. Characterize long-term performance of HPLC
    - Make caffeine standard
    - Run standard weekly
    - Characterize how the retention time and peak area change with time
1. Clean instrument, autosampler, and HPLC work area weekly.
1. Check solvents and remake/refill if needed.
1. Check HPLC waste.  Let me know if it needs to be emptied.
1. Change column (when it arrives)

### GCMS

1. Check He level and change if necessary.
1. Characterize long-term performance of GC-MS (notify me of any problems)
    - Run and analyze autotune; file report in autotune binder (weekly)
    - Run a blank (weekly)
    - Run a check standard (weekly)
    - Characterize how the retention time changes with time
1. Make sure autosampler, instrument, and work area are clean.
1. Clean instrument, autosampler, and HPLC work area weekly.
    
### Ion Chromatogram

1. Characterize long-term performance of IC
    - Make anion check standard with (F<sup>-</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, NO3<sup>-</sup>,PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>)
    - Run blank and standard bi weekly
    - Characterize how the retention time and peak area change with time
1. Check IC waste and empty if necessary

### Vacuum Pump Rebuild

- We have 4 or 5 vacuum pumps that need to be rebuilt.  Let me know if you're interested in learning how.  (Some people are very interested in this and some are not.)

# SLO 2

***Develop a routine method for analytical services of a specific type (e.g. “cannabinoid analysis”, “natural product screen in species X”, or “water quality analysis”) and/or develop new analytical equipment.***

1. Find and order juglone standard.
1. Conduct literature survey
    - Find GC-MS and HPLC analysis methods for juglone and determine which is best to start with.
    - Find extraction protocol for juglone (from insects or plant matter)
1. Develop GC-MS and/or HPLC method for juglone and analyze standard
1. Develop extraction protocol and test on walnut hulls (September/October)
1. Test instrumental method on walnut hull extract

# SLO 2

**Conduct a cost analysis and develop pricing for the proposed method and/or equipment.**

1. Determine cost-per-sample for the developed extraction and the instrumental method.
1. Research pricing for similar analyses at other labs.
1. Propose a pricing structure (fee-per-sample) for the developed methods.

# SLO 4

***Communicate the method, cost analysis, and proposed pricing in a written report.***

1. Write a technical report consisting of:
    - Introduction
    - Materials and Methods
    - Results and Discussion
    - Conclusions
    - Appendix A: Long-term instrument performance characteristics
    - Appendix B: Cost analysis
