["preface.html", "Preface", " Preface This workbook provides an introduction to instrumental analysis in the chemistry lab. Students will be introduced to components of the “analyst’s toolbox” through both introductory labs and real-world scenarios. Students will conduct spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and chromatography in labs that include sample preparation, instrument calibration, and qualitative and quantitative analysis. The techniques used are UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis, Lab 1), gas-chromatography (Lab 2), gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS, Labs 3/4), high-performance liquid chromatography (HP-LC, Labs 3/4), flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (Flame AA, Labs 3/4), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Labs 3/4). Course Overview Lab Activities Students will work in pairs at the beginning of the semester to complete introductory labs involving spectroscopy and gas chromatography. After that, they will be assigned groups of 2-3 with which they will complete one rotation lab that lasts the remainder of the semester. Students may choose to analyze e-cigarette liquid or acetaminophen tablets for their rotation lab. The rotation lab are scenario-based, so students should refer to the memorandum at the beginning of each rotation for details. The lab activities for the rotation lab are: Vape Juice Acetaminophen GC-MS (ID flavor) HPLC (Quantify acetaminophen, check purity) AA (Quantify Metal) FTIR (Check for Adulterants) FTIR (Check for Adulterants) GC-MS (ID flavor) HPLC (Quantify Nicotine, check purity) AA (Quantify Metal) Lab Notebooks Students will use Jupyter Lab as an electronic lab notebook together with Octave (or MATLAB) for data processing. Octave is an open-source programming language that is largely modeled after MATLAB, one of the most commonly used programming languages in the fields of chemistry, physics, and engineering. In general, MATLAB code will usually run in Octave. So if you get stuck in Octave, you can usually find MATLAB examples that will help solve your problem. More information on these software packages can be found in the appendices. Features of the Book Typographical Conventions This lab manual will use some common typographical (formatting) conventions to distinguish between its different features. For example, the data processing activities will make extensive use of Octave (MATLAB) code, which will always be represented with monospace font with a grey background (in the online version). It may be inline or offset. You should take time to thoroughly digest code chunks. Sometimes the code may work as-is; other times you may have to add to the code or change placeholders to make it work. And other times the code may be pseudocode, which is example code that looks like it would work but will throw an error. The code will often be color-coded to highlight various features of the programming language (a feature called syntax highlighting). The lab procedures will often contain warnings that your should watch out for. A warning will look like this! It also contains checkpoints and tips to help keep you on track. A tip or checkpoint will look like this. e-Book vs. PDF This lab manual is available in both HTML (webpage) format and as a PDF. These two formats generally have identical content, although some features of the book (such as videos) may only work in the online version and do not appear in the PDF.

["introduction.html", "Introduction", " Introduction This lab will use Vernier SpectroVis UV-visible/fluorescence spectrometers to quantify the amount of quinine in tonic water. You will be given a sample of store-bought tonic water and a concentrated stock solution of quinine. You will then dilute the stock solution to create a standard curve and measure the concentration of quinine in solution and use quality-control sample of known concentration to test the accuracy of your curve. This lab will compare results between absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. Samples and the QC will be measured in triplicate so that you can get a mean and standard deviation for your measurement, and the limit of quantitation (LOQ) will be determined from a blank sample. Students should work in pairs for the lab activity and turn in independent data analysis sheets and lab notebooks. Safety This lab uses 0.05 M sulfuric acid (SDS). Wear goggles and gloves. Tonic water contains quinine hydrochloride and the stock solution contains quinine sulfate. Although samples are over-the-counter products, you should avoid ingesting and/or contacting them with your skin.

["lab-procedure.html", "1.1 Lab Procedure", " 1.1 Lab Procedure 1.1.1 Prepare Your Standards Create your standards by diluting one of the 100-ppm quinine stock solutions to concentrations of approximately 100, 75, 40, 20, and 10 ppm using the technique of serial dilution. Use 25 mL volumetric flasks for these dilutions. It doesn’t matter if you make these concentrations exactly, what matters is that you’re in the right ballpark and know your concentrations exactly. Create a quality control sample from a separate stock solution. Make it roughly 20 ppm. Use a 50 mL volumetric flask. When creating your QC, make sure you use stock solution from a different lot and preferrably a different manufacturer. This helps check for contamination in the chemicals received from the supplier. You should also do your QC calculations entirely from scratch so that you check your math with the QC. 1.1.2 Prepare Your Samples There is no sample preparation – run all samples undiluted. 1.1.3 Acquire Data You will need Vernier Logger Lite (free) installed on your computer for these steps. Connect the spectrophotometer to your computer via USB and open Logger Lite. Go to Experiment &gt; Set up sensors &gt; Spectrometer:1. Select Fluorescence (405nm) and click OK. Select Experiment &gt; Calibrate &gt; Spectrometer:1 and follow the on-screen instructions. Your blank should be a cuvette filled with solvent and nothing else. Press Collect (play button) and load your sample. When you’re happy with the spectrum press Stop. Press Store and then double click the stored column header to name your run. Discard the sample, rinse the cuvette with DI water, and repeat the previous step as necessary for each standard/sample. You should measure each standard once, the QC in triplicate, and the sample in triplicate. When running your standards, always work from low concentration to high concentration to avoid carryover. When you are done, go to File &gt; Export As &gt; CSV… and save your spectra into a CSV (comma-separated values) file. This file type can be easily read by Octave. After the spectrometer calibration step you should run: A blank (in triplicate) Your standards (from low to high) A QC (in triplicate) Your sample (in triplicate) 1.1.4 Waste Disposal and Cleanup All acid waste should be placed in the waste container provided in the fume hood. Make sure you wash all glassware with Alconox and warm water, followed by a triple DI rinse. Shake out the glassware and put it back where you found it (with the caps on). A little residual DI water in the glassware is OK. "],

Make sure to record the ID/name in your notebook! If you don’t record the ID you cannot get credit for getting the right answer! Your runlist for this experiment is: Blank Sample 2.1.2 Setup the Instrument You will need Vernier Logger Lite (free) installed on your computer for these steps. Connect the Instrumentation Amplifier/GoLink! to your computer via USB and open Logger Lite. Go to Experiment &gt; Set up sensors &gt; GoLink:1. Select Choose Sensor and select Instrumentation Amplifier from the dropdown menu. Open the dropdown menu again and choose the 0-20 mV range for the amplifier. Use the Zero knob (on the GC) to adjust the signal until the readout is between 1 and 2 mV. Do not touch any other knobs – they are very sensitive and moving them even a small amount may lead to several additional hours of stabilization time. Let the instrument run for a minute or two until you’re cetain the baseline is stable. The instrument is “stable” when the baseline fluctuates by no more than a few percent of full-scale (20 mV in this case). 2.1.3 Load the Syringe Obtain a microliter syringe and clean it with acetone in the syringe cleaning apparatus: Place the syringe in the funnel on top of the apparatus. Turn on the vacuum pump with the black on/off switch. Squirt solvent through the syringe. Clean the plunger and the needle with a Kimwipe moistened with your solvent. For a solvent blank: Pull about 4 \\(\\mu\\)L acetone into the syringe. For a samples: Pull 4 \\(\\mu\\)L of your sample into the syringe. Pull air into the syringe until you can clearly see how much sample you loaded. Record this value in your lab notebook. 2.1.4 Inject the Sample Make sure the software is running and the instrument is ready to run. (It should be if you completed the steps above and the baseline is stable.) Push the syringe through the septum of the side B injection port and then depress the plunger. Do this step as smoothly and quickly as possible, and be consistent. The syringe plunger does not go all the way down to the glass body! Do not force it or you will ruin the syringe! Press the start button in the software. Again, the key is to be consistent with when you press the start button relative to sample injection! Allow the instrument to run for at least 5 minutes for all peaks to elute. Immediately clean the syringe in the syringe cleaning apparatus, and then repeat the loading and injection steps as needed for all blanks/samples. Make sure you clean the syringe after the last sample. 2.1.5 Save the Data When your run is finished, click the Store button and then give the run a name in the data viewer on the left side of the screen.

To: Aerosol Exposure Division From: Al Fischer, PhD Subject: e-Cigarette Liquid Analysis Western Analysts: The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports that an outbreak of e-cigarette, or vaping, associated lung injury (EVALI) began in June 2019. It continues today, and will continue until a culprit is found. As of December 17, 2019 a total of 2,506 EVALI hospitalizations from 50 states, the District of Columbia, and two U.S. territories (Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands), and 54 EVALI deaths from 27 US states have been reported to CDC. Studies have found vitamin E acetate, plant and vegetable oils, petroleum distillates, and terpenes in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of many affected individuals. [1] The figure below shows some common chemical exposures from e-cigarettes. Common exposure pathways related to e-cigarettes. Public domain image from CDC Stacks. The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) is seeking our help in finding the cause of the outbreak in NC. (See this WLOS story for additional information.) We are asked to screen e-cigarette liquid for toxicants. 3.0.0.0.1 Your job is to screen the products for: Flavoring compounds using GC-MS Nicotine concentration using HPLC Zinc concentration using flame AA (before and after vaping) General adulteration using FTIR and the Hit Quality Index method in Rodriguez et al 2011. Please turn in a technical report detailing the findings of your analyses. Your report should link together the results from all your analyses, use complementary results to bolster your conclusions, and discuss what implications the findings from each analysis have on human health. Sample Information: NCDHHS asked EVALI patients which types of of vaping liquids they used. NCDHHS acquired these products and sent them to Western Analytics for characterization. Aliquots of two samples will be randomly assigned to your workgroup for analysis. Some samples are regulated off-the-shelf e-cigarette liquid and some may be home-made or “black-market” samples. You may find problems with one, both, or none of your samples. You will also be given a toxicant-free reference sample. Although samples are over-the-counter products, they are all presumed toxic; you should avoid ingesting and/or contacting them with your skin. Record Keeping: Due to the high-impact nature of this work, you must diligently keep track of all sample information (e.g. samples names) and data. You must also follow our standard quality-control and data-validation practices to ensure your results are accurate. Likewise, all results must meet the precision guidelines described in the procedure for each instrument. Keep in mind: There are no additional samples available – plan ahead to make sure you don’t use up all your sample! The lot number for each sample (provided on the bag/vial) must be explicitly tracked in your lab notebook and final report. You must provide me with your data files and lab notebooks (in addition to your report) for validation. You must get certified on each instrument prior to using it. This is of utmost importance. The sooner the culprit(s) is (are) found, the sooner we can help get dangerous products off the shelf, and the more lives we can save! Please visit my office or email me with any questions.

["gc-ms.html", "3.1 GC-MS", " 3.1 GC-MS Gas chromatography is a technique used to separate mixtures of gases. The gases are injected into a column, which (in our case) is a long, hollow tube with a non-polar liquid coating on the inside. They are pushed through the column with a carrier gas, He in our instrument. The column is initially held at low temperature (a little above room temperature) and ramped at a defined rate up to 250 degrees C. The combination of the temperature ramp and the non-polar column allows compounds to be separated based on boiling point and polarity. GC can be paired with many different techniques, and is often used with electron-ionization mass spectrometry. This type of mass spectrometer breaks molecules apart into fragments, sorts the fragments by mass, and counts the number of fragments of each mass. The specific spectrum (or distribution of fragments) is unique for every chemical compound and is based on the stability of each bond in the molecule. In this way, the identity of a compound can usually be deduced from a mass spectrum alone, although techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy can greatly aid in identification. You will conduct liquid phase microextraction to analyze the volatile constituents of e-cigarette liquid. You should identify the major flavor constituents and comment on whether or not they may be harmful at the approximate levels present. The general order for GC-MS sampling is: (1) run solvent blanks on the GC-MS until the instrument is clean, (2) prepare a single sample using liquid-phase microextraction, (3) run the sample, and (4) repeat 2-4 as necessary. You should obtain a clean blank before preparing your samples. For GC-MS, a passing blank will have a baseline less than 50,000 counts that is stable and peak-free. You may see an increase in the baseline at temperature above 250\\(^{\\circ}\\)C; this is normal and still considered passing. If the blank is dirty you will not be able to tell what is from your sample and what is contamination! This is a qualitative analysis. Safety This lab uses small amounts of methanol (SDS). Methanol can cause blindness and absorbs through the skin. Wear gloves and goggles when working with methanol, and use it in a hood. Microliter syringes are very sharp – avoid poking yourself! Although samples are over-the-counter products, you should avoid ingesting and/or contacting them with your skin. 3.1.1 Instrumentation Run a solvent blank on the GC-MS using the CHEM370_Vape.M method. Use a microliter syringe to inject your sample and consult the GC-MS SOP. Checkpoint: A solvent blank in this case is 1 \\(\\mu\\)L methanol and nothing else. Your blank should have a baseline less than 50,000 counts that is stable and free of peaks. If you see peaks, run another blank until you don’t! If your blank is clean, prepare a sample as per below and run on the GC-MS using the CHEM370_Vape.M method. Consult the GC-MS SOP for more information. 3.1.2 Sample Preparation Place 5 drops of the e-cigarette liquid in a 2-mL GC autosampler vial. Clean a microliter syringe with the syringe cleaning apparatus. Load the syringe with 2 \\(\\mu\\)L of methanol. Place the syringe in an arm clamp/ring stand and push the GC autosampler vial onto the tip of the syringe. You want the tip of the syringe to be about 1.5 mm from the top of the sample. Do NOT let the tip touch the sample or the vial! Gently push the plunger of the syringe down all the way so that you have a small drop of methanol on the end of the syringe. Do not let the drop touch anything! The syringe plunger does not go all the way down to the glass body! Do not force it or you will ruin the syringe! Expose the drop of solvent for 30 seconds and then pull the plunger back up to pull the methanol back into the syringe. Do not bump the syringe, sample, or lab bench during this time. Inject the sample into the GC immediately. Clean the syringe and repeat as-needed for each sample. 3.1.3 Data Processing You should turn a ZIP folder containing: Your complete lab notebook as an .ipynb file, functioning with no errors. Your data files. Your completed analysis sheet. An example notebook is available here. Use the GC-MS library to get an initial idea of what compounds are present. Export your data as a CSV file and save the file to NEON. You will need to export: CSV files of your chromatograms (“TIC in R0”) A CSV of the mass spectrum for each compound you are analyzing (at minimum the most abundant compound in each sample). Transfer the data to your lab notebook folder and complete your analysis of the 2 most abundant compounds in each sample. Plot your chromatogram as Relative Abundance (%) vs. Time (minutes). Plot your mass spectra as Relative Abundance (%) vs. m/z. Clearly identify the base peak, the molecular ion, and any important isotope peaks. Also state how many rings and double bonds your molecule has, and whether it has an odd or even number of nitrogen atoms. Provide a formula, common name, and molecular weight for each compound. You must show your calculations for all of these items. See the mass spec guide for help with interpretation. Does your interpretation match the library? "],
["flame-aa.html", "3.2 Flame AA", " 3.2 Flame AA Flame atomic absorption spectroscopy is a common method of determining the concentration of specific metals (cations) in a sample. A solution is nebulized (aerosolized) into an acetylene flame where it is atomized (broken apart into its constituent atoms). The atoms in the flame absorb characteristic wavelengths of light, unique to each element. A light source specific to the analyte of interest (specifically, a hollow cathode lamp) shines through the flame, where the light gets absorbed by the sample. The amount of absorption absorbed is linearly proportional to the concentration of the analyte in solution. Although the instrument is relatively robust and inexpensive, it is limited to probing for a single analyte at a time. The general procedure for this lab is to: (1) vape a sample and collect the aerosol, (2) prepare standards, blanks, and QCs, (3) run the standards, blank, and QC, and (4) run the samples. For flame AA, the definitions of “passing” are: Blank: Flat, smooth baseline showing only random noise and/or instrument drift no greater than a few percent over 10-15 minutes. Standard Curve: A linear line with \\(R^2 \\ge 0.9990\\). QC: A measured concentration within 5% (\\(\\pm\\) 5%) of the known concentration. This is a quantitative analysis. Safety This experiment involves using an e-cigarette for an extended period of time. The cigarette may get very hot over this time period; take care not to burn yourself. Nicotine is toxic. Wear gloves when working with the vape juice and handling the e-cigarette. Do not breathe the e-liquid aerosol or let it into the room – do the vaping step in a fume hood! Never leave the flame AA unattended when the flame is on. Although samples are over-the-counter products, you should avoid ingesting and/or contacting them with your skin. 3.2.1 Standard Preparation Prepare blanks from a mix of 90% ultrapure water/5% propylene glycol/5% glycerin (solution provided for you). Prepare 5 zinc standards spanning the range of 1–10 ppm using the stock solution provided. Dilute with 90% ultrapure water/5% propylene glycol/5% glycerin (solution provided for you) using volumetric glassware. Prepare a QC from a different stock solution. The concentration should fall somewhere near the middle of your standard curve. Place your standards in 50 mL plastic centrifuge tubes for analysis. 3.2.2 Vaping and Sample Preparation Note: you only need to do this procedure with ONE of your samples! Pre-vape Sample Place approximately 1 mL of e-liquid in a tared 15-mL centrifuge tube. Obtain the mass of the liquid in the tube. Fill the tube to 10 g with ultrapure water. Filter the sample into a clean centrifuge tube using a 0.45 \\(\\mu\\)m syringe filter. Post-vape Sample Fill an e-cigarette about half full with your e-liquid. Use the laboratory vaping apparatus (peristaltic pump and collection tube) to vape the sample into a tared 15-mL centrifuge tube.

["ft-ir.html", "3.3 FT-IR", " 3.3 FT-IR FT-IR spectroscopy is used to deduce the bonds present in liquids, solids, and gases. It is widely used in industry, research, and teaching for qualitative analysis, but can also provide very accurate quantitative information. All molecules have a unique infrared spectrum, comparable to a person’s fingerprint. However, it is usually very difficult to interpret infrared spectra of mixtures. Chemometrics and linear algebra can circumvent this issue by picking out minute differences between spectra using statistical methods. During this lab, FT-IR will be used to match a sample of e-cigarette liquid to a reference spectrum using a metric called the hit quality index (HQI). This methods provides a measure of how well two spectra match, and a HQI of 0.99 or better is required to indicate a contaminant-free sample. This lab will use the Perkin Elmer Spectrum One FT-IR (Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer) to determine whether samples of Tylenol (acetaminophen) are pure. The Spectrum One is in NS 226. Before lab, read Standardization of Raman Spectra for Transfer of Spectral Libraries Across Different Instruments. Focus on the paragraph regarding hit-quality index calculation. The general order for FT-IR sampling is: (1) collect a background (no sample present) and (2) collect sample spectra by placing a drop of sample on the instrument. You will collect 3 spectra for each sample and 3 spectra of the reference sample. Safety This lab will require the use of small amounts of acetone; avoid contact with skin and eyes. Although samples are over-the-counter products, you should avoid ingesting and/or contacting them with your skin. 3.3.1 Instrumentation Use the CHEM370 user on the FTIR. Make sure you are collecting spectra as Absorbance vs. Wavenumber. Record a background spectrum on the FT-IR according to the FT-IR SOP. Place 1 drop the sample on the ATR window and acquire a spectrum. You do not need the anvil for liquid samples. Wet a Kimwipe with a small amount of acetone and clean the ATR cell with it. Repeat the above steps 2 more times, for a total of three spectra for your sample. Repeat the above steps for each sample, so you end up with three spectra of each sample. Make sure you leave the instrument and your work area clean, and log out of the computer. 3.3.2 Waste Disposal and Cleanup Clean the IR with acetone and replace the cover. Never spray acetone directly on the IR – always spray it on a Kimwipe pointed away from the instrument. Brush up any acetaminophen powder on and around the IR. Use a minimal amount of warm water to rinse any powdered acetaminophen into the bottle labelled “Hazardous Waste: Lab 2 Acetaminophen” that is stored under the sample prep hood in the Instrument Lab. Make sure your work area and the instrument are cleaner than you found them. 3.3.3 Data Processing You should turn a ZIP folder containing: Your complete lab notebook as an .ipynb file, functioning with no errors. Your data files. Your completed analysis sheet. You will need to export you data as a CSV file. The Spectrum One does this automatically. Just copy the exported data from the “Spectrum One Data Folder” (there is a shortcut on the desktop) to your folder on NEON. See Appendix 2 for examples of the following steps: Baseline correct your spectra by subtracting the minimum value from each data point. This should make the minimum value on your plot 0. Normalize your spectra by converting from absorbance units to relative absorbance. You do this by dividing the whole spectrum by the maximum absorbance value. Your final plot should range from 0 to 1. Calculate the Hit Quality Index according to Eq. 2 in Rodriguez et al (2011). Be mindful of the difference between “x” (multiplication) and “·” (dot product). "],
["hplc.html", "3.4 HPLC", " 3.4 HPLC This lab will use the Agilent 1220 HPLC (high performance liquid chromatograph) to determine the concentration of nicotine in vaping liquid. HPLC is a separation method. Like all chromatographic methods, it employs a mobile phase and a stationary phase. An analyte dissolved in solution is injected onto a column (the stationary phase) and carried through the column by a solvent, called the eluent or mobile phase. The column is packed with a substrate, which – for reverse-phase HPLC as we’ll perform here – is a non-polar substance with a C18 coating. In the column, the sample partitions between the stationary and the mobile phase, and it’s relative affinity for each determines how quickly it moves through the column. In this way, HPLC allows us to separate analytes based on polarity. In this lab, you’ll use the HPLC to perform quantitative analysis. This is possible because the area under each chromatographic peak is proportional to the concentration of each analyte. The general order for HPLC sample preparation is: (1) Prepare standard and quality control samples (QCs), (2) run standards and a QC, (3) prepare the samples, and (4) run the samples. You should obtain a clean blank, a passing standard curve, and a passing QC before preparing your samples. If any of these fails there is no point in running your samples! For HPLC, the definitions of “passing” are: Blank: Flat, smooth baseline showing only random noise and/or instrument drift no greater than a few percent over 15 minutes. Standard Curve: A linear line with \\(R^2 \\ge 0.9900\\). QC: A measured concentration within 5% (\\(\\pm\\) 5%) of the known concentration. This is a quantitative analysis. Safety Nicotine is toxic. Wear gloves when working with the vape juice and preparing standards. Although samples are over-the-counter products, you should avoid ingesting and/or contacting them with your skin. 75% water / 25% Acetonitrile / 0.1% formic acid is used as the HPLC mobile phase. Avoid skin contact with mobile phase. Reference Davis et al (2015) 3.4.1 Standard Preparation Prepare blanks from ultrapure water. Prepare nicotine standards ranging from 1–100 ppm using the stock solution provided. Use ultrapure water as your solvent. Use a separate stock solution to prepare a QC. The nicotine concentration should fall toward the middle of your standard curve. Place your standards in 2 mL HPLC autosampler vials for analysis (the ultrapure water is already filtered, so as long as you use fresh water you do not need to filter again!). 3.4.2 Running Standards Warm up the HPLC according to the HPLC SOP. Use the CHEM370_Vape.M method. Place your standards in the HPLC autosampler. Prepare a sequence based on the autosampler locations of your samples (refer to HPLC SOP for more info).

A passing QC will be within \\(\\pm\\) 5% of the known concentration. If any of these is not passing you must repeat the analysis and/or remake your standards until they pass! 3.4.3 Sample Preparation Repeat the following for each sample: Tare an HPLC sample vial. Place 2 drops of e-cigarette liquid in the vial and record the mass of liquid added. Fill to top with approximately 2 mL ultrapure water. Record the mass of the solvent you added. You will need the masses to back calculate the undiluted nicotine concentration during data analysis. Prepare enough samples to analyze all samples in triplicate. Note that the ultrapure water and e-cigarette liquid are already filtered, so you do not need to filter them again during sample prep! 3.4.4 Running Samples Warm up the HPLC according the the HPLC SOP (skip if already warm). Place your standards in the HPLC autosampler. Prepare a sequence based on the autosampler locations of your samples (refer to HPLC SOP for more info). Prepare your sequence in this order: Standards &amp; QC (see HPLC | Instrumentation: Standards section) Up to 10 samples QC Sample (same as previous QC; always finish with QC) After the instrument has warmed up, run your sequence. Analyze your standards and samples (you may skip the standards again if you’ve run them in the past hour – just start with a QC instead). Use a t-test to determine if the mass of nicotine is significantly different from the expected mass. (See Appendix 3, Comparing Means for more information on t-tests.) 3.4.5 Waste Disposal and Cleanup Place all liquid wastes in the HPLC waste container for the lab. Place all (cleaned) disposable glass vials in the broken class bin. No chemicals should go in broken glass! 3.4.6 Data Processing You should turn a ZIP folder containing: Your complete lab notebook as an .ipynb file, functioning with no errors. Your data files. Your completed analysis sheet. Exporting &amp; Plotting Representative Chromatograms You do not need to export every single chromatogram (you standards should all be very similar, just different in magnitude). Instead, export the following: The chromatogram for your medium standard. The chromatogram for each sample. Include these in your lab notebook and in a single figure in your final report. Standard Curve and Concentrations Use your standards to determine the retention time for nicotine. Use the HPLC software (or Octave if you prefer) to integrate the nicotine peak for each sample. Manually record the integration results in your lab notebook. Calculate a standard curve using a linear model with a floating intercept. Use units of ppm for your standard curve. Calculate the concentration (in ppm) of nicotine in the QCs using your standard curve. Calculate the concentration (in ppm) of nicotine in the samples using your standard curve. Perform a t-test to determine in if the concentration of nicotine in your samples is significantly different than the expected amount.

["gc-ms-1.html", "4.3 GC-MS", " 4.3 GC-MS Gas chromatography is a technique used to separate mixtures of gases. The gases are injected into a column, which (in our case) is a long, hollow tube with a non-polar liquid coating on the inside. They are pushed through the column with a carrier gas, He in our instrument. The column is initially held at low temperature (a little above room temperature) and ramped at a defined rate up to 250 degrees C. The combination of the temperature ramp and the non-polar column allows compounds to be separated based on boiling point and polarity. GC can be paired with many different techniques, and is often used with electron-ionization mass spectrometry. This type of mass spectrometer breaks molecules apart into fragments, sorts the fragments by mass, and counts the number of fragments of each mass. The specific spectrum (or distribution of fragments) is unique for every chemical compound and is based on the stability of each bond in the molecule. In this way, the identity of a compound can usually be deduced from a mass spectrum alone, although techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy can greatly aid in identification. You will conduct liquid phase microextraction to analyze the volatile constituents of children’s chewable acetaminophen. You should identify the major flavor constituents and comment on whether or not they may be harmful at the approximate levels present. The general order for GC-MS sampling is: (1) run solvent blanks on the GC-MS until the instrument is clean, (2) prepare a single sample using liquid-phase microextraction, (3) run the sample, and (4) repeat 2-4 as necessary. You should obtain a clean blank before preparing your samples. For GC-MS, a passing blank will have a baseline less than 50,000 counts that is stable and peak-free. You may see an increase in the baseline at temperature above 250\\(^{\\circ}\\)C; this is normal and still considered passing. If the blank is dirty you will not be able to tell what is from your sample and what is contamination! This is a qualitative analysis. Safety This lab uses small amounts of methanol (SDS).

Place the syringe in an arm clamp/ring stand and push the GC autosampler vial onto the tip of the syringe. Do NOT let the tip touch the powder in vial! Push the plunger of the syringe down all the way so that you have a small drop of methanol on the end of the syringe. The syringe plunger does not go all the way down to the glass body! Do not force it or you will ruin the syringe! Expose the drop of solvent for 30 seconds and then pull the plunger back up to pull the methanol back into the syringe.

["flame-aa-1.html", "4.4 Flame AA", " 4.4 Flame AA Flame atomic absorption spectroscopy is a common method of determining the concentration of specific metals (cations) in a sample. A solution is nebulized (aerosolized) into an acetylene flame where it is atomized (broken apart into its constituent atoms). The atoms in the flame absorb characteristic wavelengths of light, unique to each element. A light source specific to the analyte of interest (specifically, a hollow cathode lamp) shines through the flame, where the light gets absorbed by the sample. The amount of absorption absorbed is linearly proportional to the concentration of the analyte in solution. Although the instrument is relatively robust and inexpensive, it is limited to probing for a single analyte at a time. The general procedure for this lab is to: (1) grind and dissolve a sample of acetaminophen, (2) prepare standards, blanks, and QCs, (3) run the standards, blank, and QC, and (4) run the samples. For flame AA, the definitions of “passing” are: Blank: Flat, smooth baseline showing only random noise and/or instrument drift no greater than a few percent over 15 minutes.

We’ll use two tools to achieve a robust electronic lab notebook: (1) Jupyter Notebooks and (2) the GNU Octave programming language. The Jupyter notebook provides a place to write everything that would normally go in your lab notebook, but is entirely electronic. The Octave language is used to process data in a fashion similar to Excel, except that all actions are done by issuing commands rather than through a graphical interface. Importantly, Octave can be linked to Jupyter so that all of your data processing steps and data files can be displayed directly in your lab notebook! A visual representation of this is shown in the figure below. You can also view the notebook examples to see what a notebook actually looks like. Jupyter and Octave work together to form our Electronic Lab Notebooks. You several options for creating your notebooks: (1) You may install Jupyter and Octave directly on your personal computer (recommended), use (2) Jupyter and Octave through WCU’s VCAT interface, or (3) use MATLAB Live Notebooks through WCU’s VCAT interface. The information in this Appendix is meant to help you install Jupyter and Octave on your own computer and get started using it, and has information about starting the Jupyter in VCAT, too. This Appendix will occasionally provide screen captures of the instructions being performed; the operating system used may differ from yours, but the overall steps should be similar. "],
["installing-the-software.html", "Installing the Software", " Installing the Software The section will walk you through the two steps to installing the software used for Chem 370 Lab: (1) Installing Jupyter Lab, the notebook interface, and (2) installing Octave, the data processing software that links to Jupyter. Install Jupyter Download and install the appropriate Anaconda distribution for your operating system (Python 3.7 version). This installs Anaconda, Python, and Jupyter. Open a command-line interface: Windows: Search for anaconda prompt and open the Anaconda Powershell Prompt using the Windows search functionality. Mac/Linux: Open a Terminal Window (Mac: CMD + Space then search Terminal and open Terminal.app). Type conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab and follow any prompts that come up to install Jupyter lab. Install Octave Download and install the GNU Octave distribution appropriate for your operating system. Windows: Download the correct Windows installer here. Mac: Install Homebrew: /usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\" then run brew install octave. Linux (Ubuntu): Run apt install octave as sudo. Open a command-line interface (as above) and issue the following commands to link Octave to Jupyter Lab: conda install -c conda-forge octave_kernel Windows Only: Search for the kernel.json file and open it with Notepad. Make sure it it’s the kernel.json file in the Octave folder and not the Python folder! Make sure the file contains all of the lines below; if it doesn’t, add them in. If searching doesn’t reveal the file you can find it manually at C://Users/[your user name]/Anaconda3/share/jupyter/kernels/octave. { &quot;argv&quot;: [&quot;python&quot;, &quot;-m&quot;, &quot;octave_kernel&quot;, &quot;-f&quot;, &quot;{connection_file}&quot;], &quot;display_name&quot;: &quot;Octave&quot;, &quot;mimetype&quot;: &quot;text/x-octave&quot;, &quot;language&quot;: &quot;octave&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;octave&quot;, &quot;env&quot;: { &quot;OCTAVE_EXECUTABLE&quot;: &quot;C:\\\\Octave\\\\Octave-5.1.0.0\\\\mingw64\\\\bin\\\\octave-cli.exe&quot; } } If you can’t get Octave to work after the above steps, try clicking the text in the lower left corner of Jupyter that says Octave | ______ and then select the Octave kernel from the menu.

["ir-spectrum-processing.html", "IR Spectrum Processing", " IR Spectrum Processing IR spectra will be collected as Absorbance vs. Frequency (in wavenumbers). You will use this to calculate the hit-quality index (HQI) of each spectrum compared to a reference sample. Read Rodriguez et al 2011 for more information on HQI. The examples below assume X is defined as a spectrum containing wavenumber as the first column and absorbance and the second column. Pre-processing Often, IR spectra are normalized for comparison to each other. This is done by baseline correcting the spectra so that the minimum value is zero (i.e. subtracting the minimum value in the spectrum) and setting the maximum value of each spectrum to 1 (i.e. dividing by the maximum value). This approach is shown below. An alternative approach is mean centering, which is not shown here. You should show your normalized data when comparing spectra in your lab notebooks or reports (at least for Chem 370 lab). Baseline the data: X(:, 3) = X(:, 2) .- min(X(:, 2)); # subtract minimum abs. from all abs. values a new column ### Do this for all 3 of your spectra Normalize the data to 1: X(:, 3) = X(:, 3) ./ max(X(:, 3)); # divide all baselined abs. values by max abs. value ### Do this for all 3 of your spectra Take the mean of 3 spectra: ### Put your three spectra in a 3-column matrix sample_A = [X(:, 2) X_2(:,2) X_3(:, 2)]; ### Then, take the mean across rows sample_A = mean(sample_A, [, 2]) # you could use [, 1] to take mean of columns ### Do this for both samples and the reference Hit-quality Index Calculation The hit-quality index is defined as: \\[ HQI = \\frac{(\\text{Reference} \\cdot \\text{Sample})^2}{(\\text{Reference} \\cdot \\text{Reference}) \\times (\\text{Sample} \\cdot \\text{Sample})} \\] Note that the dot is the dot product, NOT multiplication! The dot product is easily calculated in Octave with the dot() function. The example below assumes you have created a matrix with the normalize absorbance in column 3 as per the examples above. dot(Ref(:, 3), X(:, 3))^2 / (dot(Ref(:, 3), Ref(:, 3)) * dot(X(:, 3), X(:, 3))) ### do this for both samples This produces a single value that should be less than 1. If your answer does not meet these criteria try the calculation again. Plotting IR Spectra You should always plot your normalized data when comparing spectra in your lab notebooks or reports (at least for Chem 370 lab). Note that (according to IUPAC convention) spectra are always plotted with higher energy on the left and lower energy on the right side of the \\(x\\)-axis. For IR spectra displayed with frequency as \\(x\\), this means you have to reverse the axis to be in reverse order, such that it go from higher frequency (higher energy, smaller wavelength) to lower frequency (lower energy, longer wavelength). plot(X(:, 1), sample_A); set ( gca, &#39;xdir&#39;, &#39;reverse&#39; ); #### This reverses the axis xlim([600 4000]); ylim([0 1]); # This sets the axis limits xlabel(&quot;Frequency (cm^{-1})&quot;) # Note that you can add superscripts and subscripts to labels! ylabel(&quot;Normalized Absorbance&quot;) hold on plot(X_2(:, 1), sample_B); plot(Ref(:, 1), Ref(:, 3)); hold off ### Make sure you include a legend too!

["types-of-error.html", "Types of Error", " Types of Error You will make many mistakes when analyzing your samples, and that’s OK! The important thing is that you can recognize when you’ve made a mistake and figure out how to correct it. Gross Error Gross error occurs when the analyst makes a mistake. For example, you may make your standards too concentrated, dilute a sample incorrectly, or record a value incorrectly in your lab notebook. If only one sample is affected, you can use a Grubb’s test to identify the sample as an outlier and exclude it. If the error affects all your samples, you may need to start over. See Section 22.2 in your textbook for more information. Systematic Error Systematic error occurs when a measurement is systematically high or low, usually the result of instrument drift, improper calibration, or habitual misuse of laboratory glassware (for example, filling to the top of the meniscus instead of the bottom). If your systematic error is big enough you may need to redo your analysis. See Section 22.2 in your textbook for more information. Random Error Random error occurs due to unpredictable (statistically random) fluctuations in instrument response, pipette delivery volumes, balance fluctations, etc. A key factor of random error is that it averages out as the sample size increases. Generally, there is little that can be done to eliminate random error other than increasing the averaging time and/or number of samples. See Section 22.2 in your textbook for more information. "],
