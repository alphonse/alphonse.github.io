You should have completed the first two of your instrumental techniques by Spring Break and have processed your data.  Your data will likely be imperfect, or even unusable.  That's OK.  You can fix it moving forward.  You still need to turn in your complete lab notebook and data you've collected so far, with conclusions indicating what you plan to do next.

Your notebooks will be graded on a scale of 0-5 for thoroughness and completeness.  I will look to see that all data are present, all datafiles are included, data analysis is done in the notebook and explained, all observations are included, etc.  A perfect lab notebook would get a 4; a notebook that's turned in with very little detail gets a 1.  You will get a 0 if no notebook is turned in.

  - Is the lab notebook easy to follow and digest? (-2 to 1 pt)
  - Are figures provided where needed? (-2 to 1 pt)
  - Are all observations recorded, to the appropriate number of significant digits? (-2 to 1 pt)
  - Are data files provided? (-4 to 1 pt)
  - Does the notebook run? (-4 to 1 pt)

You will also receive a grade for accuracy.  Your calculations will be checked exactly, to the appropriate number of significant digits.  You will be given a score of 1-10, where 10 indicates perfect accuracy and 1 indicates almost no accuracy.

  - Has care been given to significant digits? (2 pt)
  - Are rounding errors present? (1 pt)
  - Do the answers provided match the correct answer? (4 pt)
  - Are accurate conclusions provided? (2 pt)
