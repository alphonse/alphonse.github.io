# Overview

This course is an introduction to instrumental analysis in the chemistry lab.  Students will be introduced to components of the “analyst’s toolbox” through real-world scenarios, including spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and chromatography.   Students will conduct sample preparation, instrument calibration, and qualitative and quantitative analysis using UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS), high-performance liquid chromatography (HP-LC), flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR).  Throughout the semester, students will also work to develop skills related to reproducible data analysis, scientific communication, and collaboration in the laboratory.  Prerequisites include CHEM-232 (Quantitative Analysis) and CHEM-242 (Organic Chemistry II).

# Student Learning Outcomes

To achieve a satisfactory grade, students will:

1. Relate a theoretical, mechanical, and practical understanding of chemical instrumentation.

1. Combine concepts from Quantitative Analysis, Organic Chemistry, and General Chemistry with instrumental theory and programmatic data analysis to demonstrate accurate, reproducible qualitative and quantitative analysis of complex samples.

1. Communicate analysis questions, methods, results, and conclusions using written word, pictorial figures, and data tables.

1. Participate effectively in group projects.

1. Demonstrate safe laboratory practices.

1. Critically evaluate peer work.

These grades indicate levels in quality from excellent to unsatisfactory.  Students are responsible for knowing class attendance, withdrawal, and drop-add policies and procedures.

### Submitting Assignments

Most assignments will be submitted electronically.  Unless otherwise specified, assignments are due at 23:59:59 on the due date (usually the day before lab).  

 - A file submission URL or Blackboard submission folder will be provided for each assignment.  Assignments submitted through said URL are visible only by the instructor.
 - Students must provide their name via the file submission link to get credit.  For group assignments, put the group name in the submission fields instead; only one submission per group per assignment is necessary.
 - Files should be given a clear, logical filename that reflects the assignment name.
 - Files may be sorted automatically by a computer.  Therefore, any files not named appropriately, not in the specified format, or submitted elsewhere will either incur point deductions or not be graded.
 - Any electronic assignments turned in via hardcopy will not be graded.

Submissions that do not follow these guidelines may incur point deductions.

### Late Work

Late work is not accepted in this course.  Due dates are automatically enforced by software.  However:  

- Assignments are accepted up to 7 days *early* and students are encouraged to submit assignments before the due date.  Extra credit of 5% per assignment is granted for assignments submitted more than 24 hours early!
- Each student is granted one exception to the late policy.  You must fill out a [late work exception form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=WluzxdUWFESO4XvecFQ_GwFnoMNxJhxDhln9pQs53sVUOEMxSk9IWThGUExPNEEzTTlONTJXR1dSNS4u) to use your exception.  You may use this exception for any reason, but bear in mind future exceptions aren't guaranteed.  Exceptions cannot be used on pass/fail assignments.
- If you experience *extenuating circumstances* (e.g. a medical emergency, professionally diagnosed illness, or death in the family) or a [*university-sponsored absence*](https://www.wcu.edu/experience/health-and-wellness/student-concern-response-team/absence-notification-protocol.aspx) you may ask to be considered for an extension on a case-by-base basis.  Communication of the issue to your instructor and identification of when you plan to turn in the assignment are important in such circumstances.  For university-sponsored absences, exceptions should be arranged *before* your absence or will not be granted.

<!-- - Assignments worth less than 15 points (including pass/fail assignments) will not be accepted late.
- Lab reports and assignments worth more than 15 points will be accepted up to 7 calendar days after the due date with a deduction of 5 percent per day; no work will be accepted after 7 days (including weekends).  An exception to this rule occurs when the assignment is due on the last day/weekend before finals; these assignments will not be accepted late.
- For work that IS accepted late, a separate late submission link will be provided.  If no late submission link is provided the assignment is not accepted late. -->

### Grading Technology

Some items may be graded by computer software.  Any answers not in the specified format will not be graded.  Written work may be checked for plagiarism using computer software.  Plagiarism will NOT be tolerated (see policies in *Fine Print*, below).  Due dates/times are computer-enforced.

# The Fine Print...

## Course Policies

**Classroom Expectations:** The shared learning space of the college classroom is built on respect for each other and each other’s learning. Learning together means our actions can intentionally and unintentionally distract others from their learning goals. As responsible learners who respect the rights of others and vow to minimize avoidable distractions such as: non-academic technology use, coming in late, sleeping, off-topic discussions, doing other homework, eating, etc.

***Proper Laboratory Attire:*** Students must arrive to lab wearing appropriate attire.  Students without appropriate attire will be asked to leave and will not be able to complete the activity for the day (and will be counted absent).  
- Wear eye protection at all times (whenever you are in the room).  
- Wear closed-toed shoes that fully cover your feet up to the ankle at all times.
- Wear long pants that extend over the top of your shoes at all times.
- Wear a hair tie for long hair.
- Never wear tank tops, sleeveless shirts, shorts, or sandals.

***Laboratory Behavior:*** Never bring food or drink into the laboratory.  This includes sealed bottles and items inside backpacks – leave them outside the lab!  Do not chew gum, use tobacco products, or apply cosmetics in the lab.  Do not place personal items inside fume hoods or where they may come into contact with chemicals.  Keep walkways clear of chairs, bookbags, etc.  Wash your hands before leaving lab, and never wear gloves or lab coats outside the lab!

The sparing use of cell phones during lab sessions is permitted but discouraged. If you must, please use your cell phone outside the laboratory, and never leave an experiment unattended to do so!

In an effort to maintain a productive work environment for all students, please refrain from playing music, videos, etc., in the classroom.

***Pregnancy:*** Certain chemicals can have severe harmful effects on unborn children.  Any student who is pregnant or might have become pregnant and wished to avoid these hazards should notify her TA or instructor before conducting any laboratory work so that proper safety precautions can be taken.

**Attendance:** Please email your instructor *ahead of time* if you encounter circumstances that absolutely prevent you from making it to lab on time.  Attendance to all class periods is mandatory. Absences from group work sessions may incur a loss of points up to a zero for the assignment and deductions in the student's participation grade.  

**Inclement Weather:** Please check the University website for campus closings during times of bad weather.  Your safety is a priority when traveling. Use common sense when attempting to get to campus and notify your instructor if you are unable to safely make it.  Announcements will be made via e-mail if class must be cancelled when the University has not officially closed.

**Composition-Condition Marks:** Proper mastery of the English language will be considered when assessing written work. A student whose written work fails to meet acceptable standards will be assigned a composition-condition (CC) mark by the instructor on the final grade report. All undergraduates who receive two CC grades prior to the semester in which they complete 110 hours at WCU are so notified by the registrar and are required to pass English 300 or English 401 before they will be eligible for graduation. This course must be taken within two semesters of receiving the second CC and must be passed with a grade of C (2.0) or better. Students needing assistance with writing are encouraged to get help from WaLC. All written work submitted for this class may be checked with SafeAssign.

**Civil Discourse at Western Carolina:** Consistent with WCU’s core values and our campus creed, the WCU community accepts the freedoms and responsibilities of our shared community. WCU encourages all to clearly express their own views while at the same time seeking to understand the varieties of style, identity, and opinion that are held in any diverse community. In order for us to sustain a learning environment that promotes and values freedom of expression, we have a shared charge to accept personal responsibility for our actions, reactions, and speech, while seeking to learn from the actions, reactions, and speech of others.

<!-- Proper Laboratory Attire: Students must arrive to lab wearing appropriate attire. Students without appropriate attire will be asked to leave and will not be able to complete the activity for the day (and will be counted absent). Students who forget their goggles may “rent” a pair for a cost of 5 points subtracted from their grade.

- Wear goggles at all times (whenever you are in the room).
- Wear closed-toed shoes that fully cover your feet up to the ankle at all times.
- Wear long pants that extend over the top of your shoes at all times.
- Wear a hair tie for long hair.
- Never wear tank tops, sleeveless shirts, shorts, or sandals.

**Academic Integrity Policy and Reporting Process:** This policy addresses academic integrity violations of undergraduate and graduate students. Students, faculty, staff, and administrators of Western Carolina University strive to achieve the highest standards of scholarship and integrity. Any violation of the Academic Integrity Policy is a serious offense because it threatens the quality of scholarship and undermines the integrity of the community. While academic in scope, any violation of this policy is by nature, a violation of the Code of Student Conduct and will follow the same conduct process (see ArticleVII.B.1.a.). If the charge occurs close to the end of an academic semester or term or in the event of the reasonable need of either party for additional time to gather information timelines may be extended at the discretion of the Department of Student Community Ethics (DSCE).

Instructors have the right to determine the appropriate academic sanctions for violations of the Academic Integrity Policy within their courses, up to and including a final grade of “F” in the course in which the violation occurs.

Definitions:

- *Cheating*: Using, or attempting to use, unauthorized materials, information, or study aids in any academic exercise.
- *Fabrication*: Creating and/or falsifying information or citation in any academic exercise.
- *Plagiarism*: Representing the words or ideas of someone else as one’s own in any academic exercise.
- *Facilitation*: Helping or attempting to help someone to commit a violation of the Academic Integrity Policy in any academic exercise (e.g. allowing another person to copy information during an examination).
