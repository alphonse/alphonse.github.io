*UPDATE: March 22, 2020*

In an effort to provide a more fruitful and consistent learning experience for the remainder of the semester, I'm asking that you all use the data I've provided you when completing your lab notebooks and technical reports.  ***Do not use the data you already collected.***  This will (1) ensure that your data meets the quality standards set for the class and (2) ensure everyone has consistently formatted data.  In turn, the latter point will help you follow along with my data processing tutorials and will make it easier for me to help you troubleshoot remotely when you run into errors.

I've created a new page within the class website that contains instructional materials for online learning:  

- I've linked short videos and online textbooks that will provide a basic explanation of each instrument.  Please view these materials before attempting the data analysis -- I'll assume you know the very basics about each technique before you analyze the data.

- I'll be posting videos in which I'll process example data for each technique.  This data will be in exactly the same format as yours (although the specific values will be different).  These are not meant as lecture-style videos; rather, I intend for you to follow along with them, pausing and rewinding as needed, as you complete you analysis steps listed in the lab manual.

- I'll assume you're familiar with the content of the MATLAB and Markdown tutorials your did at the beginning of the semester when creating my videos; please review those materials if necessary.

You should complete these items ***in the order they are listed on the page.***  For example, I'll assume you've completed the flame AA exercise, which appears first, prior to completing the FT-IR exercise, which appears second.

I'll still be available the first week during our normal class time on Zoom (Link to me: [890-005-8308](https://wcu.zoom.us/j/8900058308), and in later weeks if it turns out to be useful.  Perhaps obviously, I've had to cancel all in-person appointments for the rest of the semester.  You can still schedule an appointment on Calendly, but we will meet via Zoom (or Google Hangouts if you prefer) instead of in person (unfortunately my home internet connection does not have enough bandwidth for video chat on Zoom, only instant messaging).

Thanks for your patience as we work through this evolving situation.  I hope you and your families all stay healthy in the coming months.

*March 13, 2020*

CHEM 370 Students,

In an attempt to limit the spread of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and in accordance with WCU's [guidance](https://www.wcu.edu/coronavirus/campus-update.aspx), CHEM 370 will cease in-person lab activities indefinitely.  However, class *will* resume remotely after the extended break, and ***assignment due dates will, for the most part, remain unchanged***.  Please see the assignment submission page for your section ([Monday]({{site.url}}/archive/chem370-s2020/assignments/submissions-monday.html) or [Wednesday]({{site.url}}/archive/chem370-s2020/assignments/submissions-wednesday.html)) to view assignments and due dates for the remainder of the semester.

For now, you should plan to finish your entire rotation project remotely using data I'll provide (info below).   Please understand that this is a fluid situation, and this plan is subject to change as necessary.  If/when WCU returns to traditional instruction, I will consider additional, shorter lab projects so that you still get hands-on experience with the instruments.  

Over the next few weeks I'll continue to send updates and communicate with you via email, so check it routinely.  

# How to Complete Your Assignments

*Please read these guidelines thoroughly.*

In the coming days, your group will be provided with a folder containing CSV files related to your project.  Some files will contain data you've already turned in, and some will be new data I provide for you.

You should use these data to complete your lab notebook assignments, the four data analysis worksheets, and your group technical report by the specified due dates as previously planned.

### Lab Notebooks

- I will be grading and returning your first two notebooks shortly (the ones you turned in before Spring Break).  ~~You should finish these notebooks as originally planned with a Title, Intro, Materials & Methods, Results & Data Processing, Conclusion, and References.~~ [UPDATE 3/22: You should update these with the new data; you do not need all your methods (see next bullet point).]
- For the second two notebooks (those you haven't yet turned in), you should complete all sections. ~~EXCEPT the Materials & Methods -- omit this section.~~ [UPDATE 3/22: You should include your instrument parameters table and, for the two instruments you did not take a quiz on, a block diagram. (**See [below](#below) for additional info on block diagram requirements**.)]
- Resultantly, the rubrics may change slightly; however, the expectations are still the same.  Your notebooks will be graded for overall thoroughness and clarity, and your analysis worksheets will be used to gauge your accuracy in processing the data.

### Lab Reports

- You will still complete your technical report in stages as previously planned.  Future due dates will remain the same.
- You will still complete a peer-review assignment towards the end of the semester in which you review another group's technical report.

### Instrument Quizzes

- No more instrument quizzes will be administered for the remainder of the semester.
<a id="below"/>
- Instead, include a  *block diagram* of the instrument along with a 1-2 paragraph description explaining your block diagram and how the instrument works in the **Introduction** to your lab notebook.  I've added an example [block diagram]({{site.url}}/archive/chem370-s2020/notebooks/notebook-guide#block-diagram) to the lab notebook guide. The points for these will count as your second instrument quiz.  [You will complete two diagrams total - one for each instrument you didn't yet have a quiz on.]

### Data Analysis Worksheets

- Complete these as planned using the data provided.  As mentioned above, the included notebook rubrics may change slightly.

# Getting in Touch with Me

The best way to reach me is via email.  ~~I will continue to be on campus as necessary, though likely with reduced hours.  If you must meet with me in person I suggest scheduling an appointment using [Calendly](https://calendly.com/drfischer/office-hours), although I really encourage you to remain home as much as possible.~~  [Update March 18: According to WCU's new guidelines, you should not be on campus and neither should I -- no in-person appointments are possible at this time.]

At least for the first week back, I'll be logged into Zoom during our normal class time.  Zoom allows chatting/instant messaging and also allows screen sharing for programming issues.  To get started, please see WCU's page on using Zoom: [https://collab.wcu.edu/index.php/zoom/](https://collab.wcu.edu/index.php/zoom/).  Once you've gotten it setup, you can find me by searching for "Al Fischer" in the upper right corner of the app and clicking the "Chat ðŸ’¬" icon next to my name.  If this feature gets used the first week I will continue to log in during subsequent weeks.

I hope you all enjoy your extended break.  And of course please [take steps to avoid getting sick and spreading the virus](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention.html) -- not just for your personal health and well-being, but especially to "[flatten](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/10/21171481/coronavirus-us-cases-quarantine-cancellation) the [curve](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca)" and eliminate strain on our finite healthcare resources.
