### Writing guidelines (based on common mistakes):

- Make your report thorough yet concise.

- Be specific.

     - *Bad:* Samples were ~~heated~~ in an oven overnight.
     - *Good:* Samples were placed in an **80°C oven for 8 hours**.

- Avoid unnecessary words and phrases.

     - *Bad:* ~~It has been reported that~~ air pollution 7 million deaths per year.
     - *Good:* Air pollution causes 7 million deaths per year [Ref 1].

- Avoid too many/uncommon abbreviations, and define abbreviations the first time used (with a few exceptions, below); abbreviations should be appropriate for your audience.

     - *Abbreviations that do not need to be defined:* Element names (Cu) and well-known units (m, ml, °C, K, etc.)
     - *Good abbreviations, when defined:* Instrumental techniques, certain chemicals that are more commonly/easily known by their abbreviation (e.g. 4-MP).
     - *Bad abbreviations:* Tylenol (T-ol), acetaminophen (AM)

- Use passive voice.

     - *Bad:* ~~We analyzed~~ the scent of garlic using GC-MS.  ~~We chopped~~ 1 g of garlic and placed it in a sample vial for analysis.
     - *Good:* The scent of garlic was analyzed using GC-MS.  1.0 g garlic was finely chopped and placed in a sample vial.

- Use past tense for observations and methods.

     - *Bad:* Tylenol-brand tablets ~~contain~~ 5% less acetaminophen than advertised.
     - *Good:* Tylenol-brand tablets **contained** 5% less acetaminophen than advertised.

- Use present tense for accepted facts.

     - *Bad:* Tylenol ~~helped~~ relieve headaches.
     - *Good:* Tylenol **helps** relieve headaches.

- Avoid faulty or incomplete comparisons.

     - *Bad:* These ~~results~~ are similar to ~~previous studies~~.
     - *Good:* These **results** are similar to the **results of** previous studies
     - *Bad:* ~~Fractional distillation worked better.~~
     - *Good:* **Fractional distillation** worked better **than simple distillation**.

- Use correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation.  See *Elements of Styles* ([Strunk and White](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37134?msg=welcome_stranger)) for more detail.
