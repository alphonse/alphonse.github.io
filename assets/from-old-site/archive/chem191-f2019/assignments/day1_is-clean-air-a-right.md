> Every minute of every day, a young child dies of illness caused by air pollution. In that same minute, a dozen adults will die, prematurely, because of dirty air inhaled during their lifetime.
>
> The total - 7 million premature deaths a year - is larger than the number of deaths caused by war, murder, traffic accidents, malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS combined.
>
> Both clean air and clean water are fundamentally important to human life and wellbeing. A person can survive a few days without water, but only a few minutes without air.
>
> Clean water is recognized as a basic human right. Clean air is not, even though we have the clear, proven solutions to provide it.

# FACT SHEET: Overview of the Clean Power Plan

*US Environmental Protection Agency*
January 2017

[*https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/cleanpowerplan/fact-sheet-overview-clean-power-plan_.html*]()

> When the Clean Power Plan is fully in place in 2030, carbon pollution from the power sector will be 32 percent below 2005 levels, securing progress and making sure it continues.
The transition to cleaner sources of energy will better protect Americans from other harmful air pollution, too. By 2030, emissions of sulfur dioxide from power plants will be 90 percent lower compared to 2005 levels, and emissions of nitrogen oxides will be 72 percent lower. Because these pollutants can create dangerous soot and smog, the historically low levels mean we will avoid thousands of premature deaths and have thousands fewer asthma attacks and hospitalizations in 2030 and every year beyond.
Within this larger context, the Clean Power Plan itself is projected to contribute significant pollution reductions, resulting in important benefits, including:
>
> - Climate benefits of $20 billion
> - Health benefits of $14-$34 billion
> - Net benefits of $26-$45 billion
>
> Because carbon pollution comes packaged with other dangerous air pollutants, the Clean Power Plan will also protect public health, avoiding each year:
>
> - 3,600 premature deaths
> - 1,700 heart attacks
> - 90,000 asthma attacks
> - 300,000 missed work days and school days

# U.S. Chamber of Commerce Testimony On Environmental Protection Agency Affordable Clean Energy Rule Proposal

*US Chamber of Commerce*

> Quite simply, the CPP [Clean Power Plan] was a bad deal for America.  It would have driven up electricity costs for businesses, consumers, and families, imposed tens of billions in annual compliance costs, and would have reduced our nation’s global competitiveness.  The Supreme Court halted the CPP in 2016, providing a strong indicator of that plan’s shaky legal foundation.
