1. [Not Graded] Mars has a radius of roughly 3400 km, about half the size of Earth.  The surface pressure on Mars is 0.636 kPa, or about 0.5% the atmospheric pressure on Earth.   Remember, $g$ (the acceleration due to gravity) is much lower on Mars, about 3.7 m/s$^2$.  Use this information to approximate the mass of Mars' entire atmosphere.

1. [Not Graded] Venus has a radius of roughly 6051 km, only slightly smaller than Earth.  The surface pressure on Venus is 9.2 MPa, or about 90 times the atmospheric pressure on Earth!  Remember, $g$ (the acceleration due to gravity) is slightly lower on Venus, about 8.9 m/s$^2$.  Use this information to approximate the mass (in kg) of Venus' entire atmosphere.

1. Both Mars and Venus have atmospheres that are roughly 95% CO$_2$ (carbon dioxide).  CO$_2$ is known to cause a strong greenhouse effect in planetary atmospheres, and is implicated in global climate change on Earth.  As expected, Venus has a very high average surface temperature of 462$^{\circ}$C, yet Mars has an average temperature of -63$^{\circ}$C.  Why isn't the greenhouse effect stronger on Mars?
