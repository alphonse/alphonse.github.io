# Field Trip Info

We will travel to Purchase Knob/the Appalachian Highlands Science Learning Center in the Great Smoky Mountain National Park for a field trip in October.  There are several reasons for this field trip.  We will:  

   - deploy the Teensy air quality sensors at the site to collect data,  
   - see the NC Department of Environmental Quality ozone monitoring station,  
   - attend a workshop about lichens and air pollution by [Dr. James Lendemer](https://www.nybg.org/person/james-lendemer/), a lichenologist from the New York Botanical Garden,  
   - collect data for an ongoing citizen science project at the site.  

Students are asked to make every effort to attend the field trip and will receive a grade for the day's activities.  However, it's noted that scheduling conflicts may prohibit some students from attending.  Therefore, students who cannot attend the field trip will be given an option to write a paper detailing the topic of lichens and air quality to make up the missed credit.

Students who attend the field trip will be eligible to count the course as a service learning course for the Lily Community Engagement Award; students who do not attend the field trip will not be eligible.
