# CHEM 191 - Hello!

\vspace{1cm}

1. Introduce yourself to the person sitting next to you.

1. Ask your neighbor:

    - Where they're from:

    - What their major is (if they have one):

    - How then ended up in CHEM 191:

    - What you both have in common:

1. With your neighbor, come up with 3 questions you have about this class and/or college in general.  These could be details like "How will work be graded in this class?" or "What happens if I miss a day of class?" or broad things like "What will I learn in this class?".  You can use the questions here, but try to come up with at least two original questions.
