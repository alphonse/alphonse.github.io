# Introduction

This assignment covers Chapters 5 of [*Analytical Chemistry 2.1*](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Analytical_Chemistry/Book%3A_Analytical_Chemistry_2.1_%28Harvey%29/05%3A_Standardizing_Analytical_Methods) by Harvey involving basic analytical chemistry terms, statistical analysis, and confidence intervals.

***This assignment will be collected for a grade at the beginning of lab on Thursday.***  You will use some of the calculations in lab, and doing them before hand will ensure you have time to get the work completed in lab.

# Preparing Standards

1.  You must create quinine standards at *approximately* 100, 75, 40, 20, and 10 ppm  from a ~100-ppm stock solution.  You can:

    - Use 25 mL volumetric flasks for all your dilutions.
    - Use 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, or 20 mL pipettes for your dilutions (choose whichever works best for each solution).
    - Use multiple dilutions of the same stock or use the technique of serial dilutions (whichever you prefer/works best with the glassware provided).

    It is not important that you get *exactly* the concentrations listed above.  Use the available glassware to get close to span the range of concentrations listed with *approximately* equal spacing.
    
    **Determine which pipette to use for each standard.  Show your calculations and the final concentration for each standard.**

1. The quinine stock solution used for this lab was prepared from quinine sulfate (\ce{C20H24N2O2} · \ce{0.5H2SO4} · \ce{H2O}).  Is this a primary or secondary standard?

1. The following data represent a standard curve for fluorescence detection of quinine.

    | Concentration (ppm) | Signal (arb.) |
    | :-----------------: | :-----------: |
    | 0.00                | 2.448        |
    | 10.12               | 7.779        |
    | 20.01               | 14.105       |
    | 29.92               | 19.663       |
    | 40.06               | 27.222       |
    | 50.11               | 36.858       |

    A linear regression of the data produces:
        
      - $m$ = 0.6737
      - $b_0$ = 1.145
      - $s_r$ = 1.528
      - $R^2$ = 0.9884

    If a sample measured in triplicate provides the signals 15.676, 15.583, and 15.549, what is the concentration of the sample and it's 95% confidence interval?  Show your work.
