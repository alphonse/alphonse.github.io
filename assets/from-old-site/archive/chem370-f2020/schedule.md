This schedule is subject to change as needed.

For "In Class" work, cohort 1 meets on Mondays, cohort 2 meets on Wednesdays, and cohort 3 meets on Fridays.  Please ask your instructor if you're unsure which cohort you're in.  Unless otherwise specified, exams will be administered face-to-face.

'Lecture 1' and 'Lecture 2' represent the weekly video lectures.  These, along with the quiz at the end of the videos, should be completed every Sunday by 23:59:59.  If there is homework listed it will be due at the same time.

'In Class' work will be completed during our face-to-face meeting.

Please see the [lab schedule]({{ site.url }}/archive/chem370-f2020/lab-manual/appendix-5-schedule-of-labs.html) for details on weekly labs and lab due dates.

Students will be required to attend instrumentation workshops outside of class to learn how to use each instrument.  They will take a multiple-choice test to get a certification for that instrument.  Each student must be certified before using an instrument.  This certification contributes to your grade through SLO #1 on the syllabus.
