["features-of-the-book.html", "Features of the Book", " Features of the Book Typographical Conventions This lab manual will use some common typographical (formatting) conventions to distinguish between its different features. For example, the data processing activities will make extensive use of R code, which will always be represented with monospace font with a grey background (in the online version). It may be inline or offset. You should take time to thoroughly digest code chunks. Sometimes the code may work as-is; other times you may have to add to the code or change placeholders to make it work. And other times the code may be pseudocode, which is example code that looks like it would work but will throw an error. The code will often be color-coded to highlight various features of the programming language (a feature called syntax highlighting). The lab procedures will often contain warnings that your should watch out for. A warning will look like this! It also contains checkpoints and tips to help keep you on track. A tip or checkpoint will look like this. e-Book vs. PDF This lab manual is available in both HTML (webpage) format and as a PDF. These two formats generally have identical content, although some features of the book (such as videos) may only work in the online version and do not appear in the PDF. "],

Students are responsible for knowing class attendance, withdrawal, and drop-add policies and procedures. Submitting Assignments Most assignments will be submitted electronically. Unless otherwise specified, assignments are due at 23:59:59 on the due date (usually the day before lab). A file submission URL or Blackboard submission folder will be provided for each assignment. Assignments submitted through said URL are visible only by the instructor. Students must provide their name via the file submission link to get credit. For group assignments, put the group name in the submission fields instead; only one submission per group per assignment is necessary. Files should be given a clear, logical filename that reflects the assignment name. Files may be sorted automatically by a computer. Therefore, any files not named appropriately, not in the specified format, or submitted elsewhere will either incur point deductions or not be graded. Any electronic assignments turned in via hardcopy will not be graded. Submissions that do not follow these guidelines may incur point deductions. Late Work Late work is not accepted in this course. Due dates are automatically enforced by software. However: Assignments are accepted up to 7 days early and students are encouraged to submit assignments before the due date. Extra credit of 5% per assignment is granted for assignments submitted more than 24 hours early! Each student is granted one exception to the late policy. You must fill out a late work exception form to use your exception. You may use this exception for any reason, but bear in mind future exceptions aren’t guaranteed. Exceptions cannot be used on pass/fail assignments. If you experience extenuating circumstances (e.g. a medical emergency, professionally diagnosed illness, or death in the family) or a university-sponsored absence you may ask to be considered for an extension on a case-by-base basis. Communication of the issue to your instructor and identification of when you plan to turn in the assignment are important in such circumstances. For university-sponsored absences, exceptions should be arranged before your absence or will not be granted. Grading Technology Some items may be graded by computer software. Any answers not in the specified format will not be graded. Written work may be checked for plagiarism using computer software. Plagiarism will NOT be tolerated (see policies in Fine Print, below). Due dates/times are computer-enforced. COVID19 Policies The lab portion of Instrumental Analysis will use a Hybrid Web format. Lab work and instrumental analyses will be completed in lab, but data processing and writing will be completed outside the laboratory. Students will work in groups of 2-3 in lab, and each group will be assigned a specific time of day to attend lab. If you do not attend during this time you will not be able to complete the lab. This is necessary to help maintain the room capacity requirements introduced to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2. During all in-person meetings, students must: Wear a face mask at all times (must be ‘lab use only’ - see “Masking for a Friend” statement below). Practice social distancing (maintain a distance of 2 meters from other individuals as much as possible). Practice good hygiene practices and follow CDC guidelines to minimize spread of COVID19. Avoid coming to class if you experience and cold, flu, or COVID19 symptoms, have been diagnosed with COVID19, or have been in contact with someone who’s tested positive for COVID19 within the last 14 days. Note that these policies are subject to changes as the COVID19 pandemic grows or shrinks and recommended best-practices continue to develop. Course Policies Classroom Expectations: The shared learning space of the college classroom is built on respect for each other and each other’s learning. Learning together means our actions can intentionally and unintentionally distract others from their learning goals. As responsible learners who respect the rights of others and vow to minimize avoidable distractions such as: non-academic technology use, coming in late, sleeping, off-topic discussions, doing other homework, eating, etc. Proper Laboratory Attire: Students must arrive to lab wearing appropriate attire. Students without appropriate attire will be asked to leave and will not be able to complete the activity for the day (and will be counted absent). Wear eye protection at all times (whenever you are in the room). Wear closed-toed shoes that fully cover your feet up to the ankle at all times. Wear long pants that extend over the top of your shoes at all times. Wear a hair tie for long hair. Never wear tank tops, sleeveless shirts, shorts, or sandals. Masking for a Friend: As the WCU Community Creed articulates, members of the WCU community are expected to live by high standards of academic and personal integrity and embrace their responsibility as a member of the Catamount community. In recognition of this responsibility, and in response to the best available science and current guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, every student must wear a mask or other cloth face-covering that covers their nose and mouth while in this classroom. Students who do not have a mask will be asked to leave the classroom and only return when they follow this basic public health recommendation. Following this simple, science-based guideline will help ensure the safety of the entire Catamount community. Note that masks do little to protect the person wearing the mask; rather, they minimize the chances that someone who is already sick will spread the disease to others. When you come to class in your mask, you’re not only protecting your friends, peers, and instructors in the room with you, but also their friends, family, and loved ones, especially those in high-risk populations. Students who miss class because they are not wearing a maks will not be able to make up the work missed. Students who do not have masks can obtain them at the locations below: University Center - Main Information Desk (2nd floor) Hunter Library - Circulation Desk Belk Building – CET Dean’s Office (Room 161) Health and Human Sciences Building – CHHS Dean’s Office (Room 201) Biltmore Park Instructional Site – 3rd floor Information Desk The mask/face covering requirement for students is an expectation of our student code of conduct and violations are subject to code of conduct proceedings and disciplinary action. Faculty and staff will communicate with the Department of Student Community Ethics regarding students who do not honor the requirement. Special note for laboratory work: You must switch to a lab-use only mask when in lab. This mask should only be worn in lab and no where else and should be clearly marked as “lab use only”. In the event of a chemical spill, splash, or other event than causes your mask to become contaminated, you should remove the mask and follow appropriate rinsing protocols to remove the contaminants from your skin, just as you would with any contaminated clothing. Laboratory Behavior: Never bring food or drink into the laboratory. This includes sealed bottles and items inside backpacks – leave them outside the lab! Do not chew gum, use tobacco products, or apply cosmetics in the lab. Do not place personal items inside fume hoods or where they may come into contact with chemicals. Keep walkways clear of chairs, bookbags, etc. Wash your hands before leaving lab, and never wear gloves or lab coats outside the lab! The sparing use of cell phones during lab sessions is permitted but discouraged. If you must, please use your cell phone outside the laboratory, and never leave an experiment unattended to do so! In an effort to maintain a productive work environment for all students, please refrain from playing music, videos, etc., in the classroom. Pregnancy: Certain chemicals can have severe harmful effects on unborn children. Any student who is pregnant or might have become pregnant and wished to avoid these hazards should notify her TA or instructor before conducting any laboratory work so that proper safety precautions can be taken. Attendance: Please email your instructor ahead of time if you encounter circumstances that absolutely prevent you from making it to lab on time. Attendance to all class periods is mandatory. Absences from group work sessions may incur a loss of points up to a zero for the assignment and deductions in the student’s participation grade. If you experience any symptoms of COVID-19, cold, flu, or other contagious sickness please do NOT come to class! Likewise, do not attend if you have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 or is suspected to have COVID-19. Please maintain diligent communication with your instructor during these situations and appropriate accommodations will be made. Inclement Weather: Please check the University website for campus closings during times of bad weather. Your safety is a priority when traveling. Use common sense when attempting to get to campus and notify your instructor if you are unable to safely make it. Announcements will be made via e-mail if class must be cancelled when the University has not officially closed. Composition-Condition Marks: Proper mastery of the English language will be considered when assessing written work. A student whose written work fails to meet acceptable standards will be assigned a composition-condition (CC) mark by the instructor on the final grade report. All undergraduates who receive two CC grades prior to the semester in which they complete 110 hours at WCU are so notified by the registrar and are required to pass English 300 or English 401 before they will be eligible for graduation. This course must be taken within two semesters of receiving the second CC and must be passed with a grade of C (2.0) or better. Students needing assistance with writing are encouraged to get help from WaLC. All written work submitted for this class may be checked with SafeAssign. Civil Discourse at Western Carolina: Consistent with WCU’s core values and our campus creed, the WCU community accepts the freedoms and responsibilities of our shared community. WCU encourages all to clearly express their own views while at the same time seeking to understand the varieties of style, identity, and opinion that are held in any diverse community. In order for us to sustain a learning environment that promotes and values freedom of expression, we have a shared charge to accept personal responsibility for our actions, reactions, and speech, while seeking to learn from the actions, reactions, and speech of others.

["r-intro.html", "Introduction", " Introduction Chem 370 lab will make extensive use of electronic lab notebooks. We’ll use two tools to achieve a robust electronic lab notebook: (1) R Markdown Notebooks, (2) the R programming language, and (3) the RStudio integrated development (IDE, a tool that will make it easier to use items 1 and 2). The R Markdown (RMD) notebook provides a place to write everything that would normally go in your lab notebook, but is entirely electronic. The R language is used to process data in a fashion similar to Excel, except that all actions are done by issuing commands rather than through a graphical interface. Importantly, this configuration allows all of the data processing steps and data files you have in electronic form to be displayed directly in your lab notebook! You’ll learn more about what these software are as you complete this lab activity. The configuration described above requires the R language and the RStudio IDE. These are both freely available online for Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux. You have several options when using the software: (1) You may install R and RStudio directly on your personal computer (recommended) or (2) use R and RStudio through WCU’s VCAT interface (might be useful as a backup if your computer isn’t cooperating). Know up front that learning to program can be a daunting experience and takes time to learn. You’ll experience many occasions in which your code won’t run, and you’ll have to figure out why. This can be frustrating at times, and you may often feel lost. But programming can also be very rewarding once you start to get the hang of it! To help with your transition into the world of programmatic data analysis, you’ll be provided with several forms of tutorials. Some will be built directly into RStudio, and you’ll be able to access them after installing the Chem 370 add-on package; others will be in the form of video tutorials in which I’ll walk you through various steps of installing the software, navigating it, and processing your data. Your goals for this lab are to become familiar with the Markdown syntax, install R and R+Studio on your computer, and then create a lab notebook template using R Markdown that you’ll use to record details and data next week in lab (so make sure you bring your computer next week!).

["learning-markdown.html", "1.1 Learning Markdown", " 1.1 Learning Markdown Markdown is a markup language that was developed by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in the mid-2000’s. It provides a simple, streamlined utility for word processing and web page creation. It’s been adopted in many places, which numerous websites, message boards, blogs, and even all the materials for this course being written in Markdown. In essence, the writer creates a plain text document (extension: .txt or .md) and uses software to render the Markdown into a nicely formatted document (originally just HTML (web format), but now there’s support for PDFs, Word Docs, and more). The language is quite simple; if you can use Word, you can easily use Markdown. The tutorial linked below will help you get started. TASK: Complete the Markdown Tutorial "],
["install-r.html", "1.2 Installing R + RStudio", " 1.2 Installing R + RStudio R is the programming language we’ll use to process data this semester. We’ll discuss more of the details about what R is and why we’re using it in a few weeks. For now we just need to get it installed and create a basic Markdown document. RStudio is a peice of software called an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides a unified interface for all the tools we need to use R. It is highly recommended that you use RStudio to interact with R. The steps below will walk you through installing both of them. The following video shows you how to complete the steps listed below: 1.2.1 Install R (Must be done first) Open a web browser and navigate to the Duke University R Mirror and click the link for your operating system (Windows, Mac OSX, Linux). Follow the on-screen prompts to install R (will vary by operating system). 1.2.2 Install RStudio Once you’ve successfully installed R, navigate to the RStudio downloads page and click the link to download the version that matches your operating system. Follow the on-screen prompts to install RStudio (will vary by operating system). 1.2.3 Installing the CHEM 370 Package One of the great things about R is that anyone can develop add-ons (called “packages”) for it. I’ve developed a package for Chem 370 that has functions and tutorials specifically for this class. You’ll need to install it to follow along with the tutorials. Once you’ve installed R and RStudio, you open up RStudio (opening RStudio also opens an R session automatically). Install the devtools package, which will make it easier to install the Chem 370 package. In RStduio, navigate to the Packages tab in the lower right pane and click Install. In the dialog that opens, type in devtools on the Packages line. Click Install. If you get a “non-zero exit status” or error message, read through it to see if you find “package ‘XYZ’ not available” and then install the package(s) it mentions. Try installing devtools again after that. Install the instRumental package: In Rstudio, find the Console tab in the lower left pane. Copy and paste the following lines exactly: require(devtools) install.packages(&quot;learnr&quot;) install_github(&quot;rstudio-education/gradethis&quot;) install_github(&quot;dr-fischer/instRumental&quot;) The instRumental package should now be installed on your system.

There are two gas chromatographs available for this task, and your goal is to determine which works best. You will run the sample on both instruments and compare their performance. Specifically, one lab partner will use a Gow-Mac 150-series isothermal gas chromatography and the other will use a Gow-Mac 400-series. Both use thermal conductivity detectors (GC-TCD) and work on the same principles. They separate compounds by both boiling point and polarity, and produce a peak for each component wherein the peak area is proportional to the amount of that component present.

Make sure to record the ID/name in your notebook! If you don’t record the ID you cannot get credit for getting the right answer! Your run list for this experiment is, on each instrument: Blank Sample 2.1.2 Setup the Instrument You will need Vernier Logger Lite (free) installed on your computer for these steps. Due to increased time constraints with COVID19, these steps will be completed for you. A computer and the software will be provided. Connect the Instrumentation Amplifier/GoLink! to your computer via USB and open Logger Lite. Go to Experiment &gt; Set up sensors &gt; GoLink:1. Select Choose Sensor and select Instrumentation Amplifier from the dropdown menu. Open the dropdown menu again and choose the 0-20 mV range for the amplifier. Use the Zero knob (on the GC) to adjust the signal until the readout is between 1 and 2 mV. Do not touch any other knobs – they are very sensitive and moving them even a small amount may lead to several additional hours of stabilization time. Let the instrument run for a minute or two until you’re cetain the baseline is stable. The instrument is “stable” when the baseline fluctuates by no more than a few percent of full-scale (20 mV in this case). 2.1.3 Load the Syringe Obtain a microliter syringe and clean it with acetone in the syringe cleaning apparatus: Place the syringe in the funnel on top of the apparatus. Turn on the vacuum pump with the black on/off switch. Squirt solvent through the syringe. Clean the plunger and the needle with a Kimwipe moistened with your solvent. For a solvent blank: Pull about 4 \\(\\mu\\)L acetone into the syringe. Record how much you end up loading into the syringe. For samples: Pull 4 \\(\\mu\\)L of your sample into the syringe. Make sure inject exactly the same amount into each instrument. Pull air into the syringe until you can clearly see how much sample you loaded. Record this value in your lab notebook. 2.1.4 Inject the Sample Make sure the software is running and the instrument is ready to run. (It should be if you completed the steps above and the baseline is stable.) Push the syringe through the septum of the side B injection port and then depress the plunger. Do this step as smoothly and quickly as possible, and be consistent. The syringe plunger does not go all the way down to the glass body! Do not force it or you will ruin the syringe! Press the start button in the software. Again, the key is to be consistent with when you press the start button relative to sample injection! Allow the instrument to run for at least 5 minutes for all peaks to elute. Immediately clean the syringe in the syringe cleaning apparatus, and then repeat the loading and injection steps as needed for all blanks/samples. Make sure you clean the syringe after the last sample. 2.1.5 Save the Data When your run is finished, click the Store button and then give the run a name in the data viewer on the left side of the screen. When all of your runs have finished go to File &gt; Export As &gt; CSV to save your data as a CSV file for processing. "],

You will need to change the time for each peak. ### ... and so on Find the percent composition for each unknown peak. The percent composition for peak \\(n\\) is: \\[ C_n(\\%)=\\frac{A_n}{A_1 + A_2 + ... A_n} \\times 100\\% \\] where \\(A_n\\) represents the peak area of peak \\(n\\). Devise a way program this in Octave. Estimate the signal to noise (S/N) ratio for each peak.

["uv-vis-intro.html", "Introduction", " Introduction This lab will use Vernier SpectroVis UV-visible/fluorescence spectrometers to quantify the amount of quinine in tonic water. You will be given a sample of store-bought tonic water and a concentrated stock solution of quinine. You will then dilute the stock solution to create a standard curve and measure the concentration of quinine in solution and use quality-control sample of known concentration to test the accuracy of your curve. This lab will compare results between absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. Samples and the QC will be measured in triplicate so that you can get a mean and standard deviation for your measurement, and the limit of quantitation (LOQ) will be determined from a blank sample. Students should work in pairs for the lab activity and turn in independent data analysis sheets and lab notebooks. Watch Dr. Fischer teardown a SpectroVis and find out what’s inside! Safety This lab uses 0.05 M sulfuric acid (SDS). Wear goggles and gloves. Tonic water contains quinine hydrochloride and the stock solution contains quinine sulfate.

["uv-vis-procedure.html", "3.1 Lab Procedure", " 3.1 Lab Procedure 3.1.1 Prepare Your Standards Create your standards by diluting one of the 100-ppm quinine stock solutions to concentrations of approximately 100, 75, 40, 20, and 10 ppm using the technique of serial dilution. Use 25 mL volumetric flasks for these dilutions. It doesn’t matter if you make these concentrations exactly, what matters is that you’re in the right ballpark and know your concentrations exactly. Create a quality control sample from a separate stock solution. Make it roughly 20 ppm. Use a 50 mL volumetric flask. When creating your QC, make sure you use stock solution from a different lot and preferably a different manufacturer. This helps check for contamination in the chemicals received from the supplier. You should also do your QC calculations entirely from scratch so that you check your math with the QC. 3.1.2 Prepare Your Samples There is no sample preparation – run all samples undiluted. 3.1.3 Acquire Data You will need Vernier Logger Lite (free) installed on your computer for these steps. Connect the spectrophotometer to your computer via USB and open Logger Lite. Go to Experiment &gt; Set up sensors &gt; Spectrometer:1. Select Fluorescence (405nm) and click OK. Select Experiment &gt; Calibrate &gt; Spectrometer:1 and follow the on-screen instructions. Your blank should be a cuvette filled with solvent and nothing else. Press Collect (play button) and load an aliquot of your high standard. You should see a spectrum of Intensity vs. Wavelength (nm). Use this spectrum to determine \\(\\lambda_{max}\\), the wavelength of maximum emission. Discard the sample and rinse the cuvette with DI water. Configure the spectrometer to measure at \\(\\lambda_{max}\\) (determined in the previous step). Click the Wave or Configure Spectrometer button in the menu bar. Set the spectrometer to collect Fluorescence vs. Concentration. Choose Individual Wavelengths. Select the check box next to the wavelength corresponding to \\(\\lambda_{max}\\). Run your blank, standards (low to high), QC, and sample. Rinse the cuvette with DI between each sample. Click Collect. Click Keep and enter the concentration or a unique ID for each sample. You should measure each standard once, the QC in triplicate, and the sample in triplicate. When running your standards, always work from low concentration to high concentration to avoid carryover. When you are done, go to File &gt; Export As &gt; CSV… and save your spectra into a CSV (comma-separated values) file. 3.1.4 Waste Disposal and Cleanup All acid waste should be placed in the waste container provided in the fume hood. Make sure you wash all glassware with Alconox and warm water, followed by a triple DI rinse. Shake out the glassware and put it back where you found it (with the caps on). A little residual DI water in the glassware is OK. "],

To: Aerosol Exposure Division From: Al Fischer, PhD Subject: e-Cigarette Liquid Analysis Western Analysts: The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports that an outbreak of e-cigarette, or vaping, associated lung injury (EVALI) began in June 2019. It continues today, and will continue until a culprit is found. As of December 17, 2019 a total of 2,506 EVALI hospitalizations from 50 states, the District of Columbia, and two U.S. territories (Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands), and 54 EVALI deaths from 27 US states have been reported to CDC. Studies have found vitamin E acetate, plant and vegetable oils, petroleum distillates, and terpenes in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of many affected individuals. [1] The figure below shows some common chemical exposures from e-cigarettes. Common exposure pathways related to e-cigarettes. Public domain image from CDC Stacks. The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) is seeking our help in finding the cause of the outbreak in NC. (See this WLOS story for additional information.) We are asked to screen e-cigarette liquid for toxicants. 4.0.0.0.1 Your job is to screen the products for: Flavoring compounds using GC-MS Nicotine concentration using HPLC Zinc concentration using flame AA (before and after vaping) General adulteration using FTIR and the Hit Quality Index method in Rodriguez et al 2011. Please turn in a technical report detailing the findings of your analyses. Your report should link together the results from all your analyses, use complementary results to bolster your conclusions, and discuss what implications the findings from each analysis have on human health. Sample Information: NCDHHS asked EVALI patients which types of of vaping liquids they used. NCDHHS acquired these products and sent them to Western Analytics for characterization. Aliquots of two samples will be randomly assigned to your workgroup for analysis. Some samples are regulated off-the-shelf e-cigarette liquid and some may be home-made or “black-market” samples. You may find problems with one, both, or none of your samples. You will also be given a toxicant-free reference sample. Although samples are over-the-counter products, they are all presumed toxic; you should avoid ingesting and/or contacting them with your skin. Record Keeping: Due to the high-impact nature of this work, you must diligently keep track of all sample information (e.g. samples names) and data. You must also follow our standard quality-control and data-validation practices to ensure your results are accurate. Likewise, all results must meet the precision guidelines described in the procedure for each instrument. Keep in mind: There are no additional samples available – plan ahead to make sure you don’t use up all your sample! The lot number for each sample (provided on the bag/vial) must be explicitly tracked in your lab notebook and final report. You must provide me with your data files and lab notebooks (in addition to your report) for validation. You must get certified on each instrument prior to using it. This is of utmost importance. The sooner the culprit(s) is (are) found, the sooner we can help get dangerous products off the shelf, and the more lives we can save! Please visit my office or email me with any questions.

["gc-ms.html", "4.1 GC-MS", " 4.1 GC-MS Gas chromatography is a technique used to separate mixtures of gases. The gases are injected into a column, which (in our case) is a long, hollow tube with a non-polar liquid coating on the inside. They are pushed through the column with a carrier gas, He in our instrument. The column is initially held at low temperature (a little above room temperature) and ramped at a defined rate up to 250 degrees C. The combination of the temperature ramp and the non-polar column allows compounds to be separated based on boiling point and polarity. GC can be paired with many different techniques, and is often used with electron-ionization mass spectrometry. This type of mass spectrometer breaks molecules apart into fragments, sorts the fragments by mass, and counts the number of fragments of each mass. The specific spectrum (or distribution of fragments) is unique for every chemical compound and is based on the stability of each bond in the molecule. In this way, the identity of a compound can usually be deduced from a mass spectrum alone, although techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy can greatly aid in identification. You will conduct liquid phase microextraction to analyze the volatile constituents of e-cigarette liquid. You should identify the major flavor constituents and comment on whether or not they may be harmful at the approximate levels present. The general order for GC-MS sampling is: (1) run solvent blanks on the GC-MS until the instrument is clean, (2) prepare a single sample using liquid-phase microextraction, (3) run the sample, and (4) repeat 2-4 as necessary. You should obtain a clean blank before preparing your samples. For GC-MS, a passing blank will have a baseline less than 50,000 counts that is stable and peak-free. You may see an increase in the baseline at temperature above 250\\(^{\\circ}\\)C; this is normal and still considered passing. If the blank is dirty you will not be able to tell what is from your sample and what is contamination! This is a qualitative analysis. Safety This lab uses small amounts of methanol (SDS). Methanol can cause blindness and absorbs through the skin. Wear gloves and goggles when working with methanol, and use it in a hood. Microliter syringes are very sharp – avoid poking yourself! Although samples are over-the-counter products, you should avoid ingesting and/or contacting them with your skin. 4.1.1 Instrumentation Run a solvent blank on the GC-MS using the CHEM370_Vape.M method. Use a microliter syringe to inject your sample and consult the GC-MS SOP. Checkpoint: A solvent blank in this case is 1 \\(\\mu\\)L methanol and nothing else. Your blank should have a baseline less than 50,000 counts that is stable and free of peaks. If you see peaks, run another blank until you don’t! If your blank is clean, prepare a sample as per below and run on the GC-MS using the CHEM370_Vape.M method. Consult the GC-MS SOP for more information. 4.1.2 Sample Preparation Place 5 drops of the e-cigarette liquid in a 2-mL GC autosampler vial. Clean a microliter syringe with the syringe cleaning apparatus. Load the syringe with 2 \\(\\mu\\)L of methanol. Place the syringe in an arm clamp/ring stand and push the GC autosampler vial onto the tip of the syringe. You want the tip of the syringe to be about 1.5 mm from the top of the sample. Do NOT let the tip touch the sample or the vial! Gently push the plunger of the syringe down all the way so that you have a small drop of methanol on the end of the syringe. Do not let the drop touch anything! The syringe plunger does not go all the way down to the glass body! Do not force it or you will ruin the syringe! Expose the drop of solvent for 30 seconds and then pull the plunger back up to pull the methanol back into the syringe. Do not bump the syringe, sample, or lab bench during this time. Inject the sample into the GC immediately. Clean the syringe and repeat as-needed for each sample. 4.1.3 Data Processing The following videos walk you through the data processing portion of this lab. You should turn a ZIP folder containing: Your complete lab notebook as an .html and .Rmd file functioning with no errors. Your data files. Your completed assessment. An example notebook is available here. Use the GC-MS library (in ChemStation or OpenChrom) to get an initial idea of what compounds are present. Move the data folder for each sample (ending in .D) to NEON. Transfer the data to your lab notebook folder and complete your analysis of the 2 most abundant compounds in each sample. Plot your chromatogram as Relative Abundance (%) vs. Time (minutes). Plot your mass spectra as Relative Abundance (%) vs. m/z. Clearly identify the base peak, the molecular ion, and any important isotope peaks. Also state how many rings and double bonds your molecule has, and whether it has an odd or even number of nitrogen atoms. Provide a formula, common name, and molecular weight for each compound. You must show your calculations for all of these items. See the mass spec guide for help with interpretation. Does your interpretation match the library? 4.1.4 Assessment Answer the following questions by saving the result as the specified R variable in an R code block.

["flame-aa.html", "4.2 Flame AA", " 4.2 Flame AA Flame atomic absorption spectroscopy is a common method of determining the concentration of specific metals (cations) in a sample. A solution is nebulized (aerosolized) into an acetylene flame where it is atomized (broken apart into its constituent atoms). The atoms in the flame absorb characteristic wavelengths of light, unique to each element. A light source specific to the analyte of interest (specifically, a hollow cathode lamp) shines through the flame, where the light gets absorbed by the sample. The amount of absorption absorbed is linearly proportional to the concentration of the analyte in solution. Although the instrument is relatively robust and inexpensive, it is limited to probing for a single analyte at a time. The general procedure for this lab is to: (1) vape a sample and collect the aerosol, (2) prepare standards, blanks, and QCs, (3) run the standards, blank, and QC, and (4) run the samples. For flame AA, the definitions of “passing” are: Blank: Flat, smooth baseline showing only random noise and/or instrument drift no greater than a few percent over 10-15 minutes. Standard Curve: A linear line with \\(R^2 \\ge 0.9990\\). QC: A measured concentration within 5% (\\(\\pm\\) 5%) of the known concentration. This is a quantitative analysis. Safety This experiment involves using an e-cigarette for an extended period of time. The cigarette may get very hot over this time period; take care not to burn yourself. Nicotine is toxic. Wear gloves when working with the vape juice and handling the e-cigarette. Do not breathe the e-liquid aerosol or let it into the room – do the vaping step in a fume hood! Never leave the flame AA unattended when the flame is on. Although samples are over-the-counter products, you should avoid ingesting and/or contacting them with your skin. 4.2.1 Standard Preparation Prepare blanks from a mix of 90% ultrapure water/5% propylene glycol/5% glycerin (solution provided for you). Prepare 5 zinc standards spanning the range of 1–10 ppm using the stock solution provided. Dilute with 90% ultrapure water/5% propylene glycol/5% glycerin (solution provided for you) using volumetric glassware. Prepare a QC from a different stock solution. The concentration should fall somewhere near the middle of your standard curve. Place your standards in 50 mL plastic centrifuge tubes for analysis. 4.2.2 Vaping and Sample Preparation Note: you only need to do this procedure with ONE of your samples! Pre-vape Sample Place approximately 1 mL of e-liquid in a tared 15-mL centrifuge tube. Obtain the mass of the liquid in the tube. Fill the tube to 10 g with ultrapure water. Filter the sample into a clean centrifuge tube using a 0.45 \\(\\mu\\)m syringe filter. Post-vape Sample Fill an e-cigarette about half full with your e-liquid. Use the laboratory vaping apparatus (peristaltic pump and collection tube) to vape the sample into a tared 15-mL centrifuge tube. Vape the sample in 5-second bursts followed by 30-second pauses to mimic an actual user. Do this step in the fume hood! Obtain the mass of the liquid in the tube. Fill the tube to 10 g with ultrapure water. Filter the sample into a clean centrifuge tube using a 0.45 \\(\\mu\\)m syringe filter. 4.2.3 Running Samples Use the Flame AA SOP to prepare a flame AA method file containing your blanks and standards. Use the CHEM370_Vape method as a template, but don’t save over the template! Prepare a Sample Information File containing your QC. Run the blanks, standards, and QC. Checkpoint: A passing blank will show no signs of contamination. A passing standard curve will have \\(R^2 \\ge 0.9990\\). A passing QC will be within \\(\\pm\\) 5% of the known concentration. If any of these is not passing you must repeat the analysis and/or remake your standards until they pass! If everything passes, add your samples to your Sample Information File. Run your newly-added samples. If you have extra sample, try screening it for other metals! (Ask how.) 4.2.4 Waste Disposal and Cleanup Collect all wastes in the Flame AA waste container. Place used (empty) centrifuge tubes in the trash. Wipe up any spilled e-cigarette liquid with a paper towel (including liquid that’s leaked onto the e-cigarette). Remove the vaping machine tubing and rinse it out with ultrapure water. 4.2.5 Data Processing The following video walks you through the data processing portion of this lab. You should turn a ZIP folder containing: Your complete lab notebook as an .html and .Rmd file functioning with no errors. Your data files. Your completed assessment. Export your data to a CSV file using the Data Manager software package (shortcut on Desktop). Use the C370_template design when prompted. Use R to create and plot a calibration curve. Determine the concentration of your samples and QCs. Remember to factor in all dilutions. Use the confidence intervals or a t-test (whichever you prefer) to determine whether the metal concentration is significantly different before and after vaping. (See Appendix 3, Comparing Means for more information on t-tests.) 4.2.6 Assessment Answer the following questions by saving the result as the specified R variable in an R code block.

["ft-ir.html", "4.3 FT-IR", " 4.3 FT-IR FT-IR spectroscopy is used to deduce the bonds present in liquids, solids, and gases. It is widely used in industry, research, and teaching for qualitative analysis, but can also provide very accurate quantitative information. All molecules have a unique infrared spectrum, comparable to a person’s fingerprint. However, it is usually very difficult to interpret infrared spectra of mixtures. Chemometrics and linear algebra can circumvent this issue by picking out minute differences between spectra using statistical methods. During this lab, FT-IR will be used to match a sample of e-cigarette liquid to a reference spectrum using a metric called the hit quality index (HQI). This methods provides a measure of how well two spectra match, and a HQI of 0.99 or better is required to indicate a contaminant-free sample. This lab will use the Perkin Elmer Spectrum One FT-IR (Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer) to determine whether e-cigarette liquids are adulterated. The Spectrum One is in NS 226. Before lab, read Standardization of Raman Spectra for Transfer of Spectral Libraries Across Different Instruments. Focus on the paragraph regarding hit-quality index calculation. The general order for FT-IR sampling is: (1) collect a background (no sample present) and (2) collect sample spectra by placing a drop of sample on the instrument. You will collect 3 spectra for each sample and 3 spectra of the reference sample. Safety This lab will require the use of small amounts of acetone; avoid contact with skin and eyes. Although samples are over-the-counter products, you should avoid ingesting and/or contacting them with your skin. 4.3.1 Instrumentation Use the CHEM370 user on the FTIR. Make sure you are collecting spectra as Absorbance vs. Wavenumber. Record a background spectrum on the FT-IR according to the FT-IR SOP. Place 1 drop the sample on the ATR window and acquire a spectrum. You do not need the anvil for liquid samples. Wet a Kimwipe with a small amount of acetone and clean the ATR cell with it. Repeat the above steps 2 more times, for a total of three spectra for your sample. Repeat the above steps for each sample, so you end up with three spectra of each sample. Make sure you leave the instrument and your work area clean, and log out of the computer. 4.3.2 Waste Disposal and Cleanup Clean the IR with acetone and replace the cover. Never spray acetone directly on the IR – always spray it on a Kimwipe pointed away from the instrument. Wipe up any e-cigarette liquid on and around the IR with acetone. Make sure your work area and the instrument are cleaner than you found them. 4.3.3 Data Processing The following video walks you through the data processing portion of this lab. You should turn a ZIP folder containing: Your complete lab notebook as an .html and .Rmd file functioning with no errors. Your data files. Your completed assessment. You will need to export you data as a CSV file. The Spectrum One does this automatically. Just copy the exported data from the “Spectrum One Data Folder” (there is a shortcut on the desktop) to your folder on NEON. See Appendix 2 for examples of the following steps: Baseline correct your spectra by subtracting the minimum value from each data point. This should make the minimum value on your plot 0. Normalize your spectra by converting from absorbance units to relative absorbance. You do this by dividing the whole spectrum by the maximum absorbance value. Your final plot should range from 0 to 1. Calculate the Hit Quality Index according to Eq. 2 in Rodriguez et al (2011). Be mindful of the difference between “x” (multiplication) and “·” (dot product). 4.3.4 Assessment Answer the following questions by saving the result as the specified R variable in an R code block.

["hplc.html", "4.4 HPLC", " 4.4 HPLC This lab will use the Agilent 1220 HPLC (high performance liquid chromatograph) to determine the concentration of nicotine in vaping liquid. HPLC is a separation method. Like all chromatographic methods, it employs a mobile phase and a stationary phase. An analyte dissolved in solution is injected onto a column (the stationary phase) and carried through the column by a solvent, called the eluent or mobile phase. The column is packed with a substrate, which – for reverse-phase HPLC as we’ll perform here – is a non-polar substance with a C18 coating. In the column, the sample partitions between the stationary and the mobile phase, and it’s relative affinity for each determines how quickly it moves through the column. In this way, HPLC allows us to separate analytes based on polarity. In this lab, you’ll use the HPLC to perform quantitative analysis. This is possible because the area under each chromatographic peak is proportional to the concentration of each analyte. The general order for HPLC sample preparation is: (1) Prepare standard and quality control samples (QCs), (2) run standards and a QC, (3) prepare the samples, and (4) run the samples. You should obtain a clean blank, a passing standard curve, and a passing QC before preparing your samples. If any of these fails there is no point in running your samples! For HPLC, the definitions of “passing” are: Blank: Flat, smooth baseline showing only random noise and/or instrument drift no greater than a few percent over 15 minutes.

Wear gloves when working with the vape juice and preparing standards. Although samples are over-the-counter products, you should avoid ingesting and/or contacting them with your skin. 75% water / 25% Acetonitrile / 0.1% formic acid is used as the HPLC mobile phase. Avoid skin contact with mobile phase. Reference Davis et al (2015) 4.4.1 Standard Preparation Prepare blanks from ultrapure water. Prepare nicotine standards ranging from 1–100 ppm using the stock solution provided. Use ultrapure water as your solvent. Use a separate stock solution to prepare a QC. The nicotine concentration should fall toward the middle of your standard curve. Place your standards in 2 mL HPLC autosampler vials for analysis (the ultrapure water is already filtered, so as long as you use fresh water you do not need to filter again!). 4.4.2 Running Standards Warm up the HPLC according to the HPLC SOP. Use the CHEM370_Vape.M method. Place your standards in the HPLC autosampler. Prepare a sequence based on the autosampler locations of your samples (refer to HPLC SOP for more info).

If any of these is not passing you must repeat the analysis and/or remake your standards until they pass! 4.4.3 Sample Preparation Repeat the following for each sample: Tare an HPLC sample vial. Place 2 drops of e-cigarette liquid in the vial and record the mass of liquid added. Fill to top with approximately 2 mL ultrapure water. Record the mass of the solvent you added. You will need the masses to back calculate the undiluted nicotine concentration during data analysis. Prepare enough samples to analyze all samples in triplicate. Note that the ultrapure water and e-cigarette liquid are already filtered, so you do not need to filter them again during sample prep! 4.4.4 Running Samples Warm up the HPLC according the the HPLC SOP (skip if already warm).

Grind your sample into a fine, homogenous powder using a mortar and pestle. Cone and quarter your sample (on weighing paper) until you have just over 100 mg. Dissolve 100.0 mg of the tablet in 1:3 methanol:water, and bring the final volume to 100.0 ml. Perform a 1:100 dilution of you sample in 1:3 methanol:water. Filter you final dilution through a 0.45 \\(\\mu\\)m syringe filter using a 20 ml syringe. Make sure you: Don’t pull up on the plunger with the filter attached to the syringe (you may tear the filter). Discard the first 10 ml of filtrate. Use an aliquot of the last 10 ml of filtrate for analysis. 5.1.4 Running Samples Place approximately 2 ml of your final dilution in an autosampler vial; you should prepare at least 3 vials to run in triplicate. Prepare the appropriate blanks, using 1:3 methanol:water as your blank solution. Please be sure to filter your blanks before analysis.

Standard Curve and Concentrations Use your standards to determine which peak in your sample is acetaminophen. Don’t disregard the peaks that aren’t acetaminophen. They contain valuable information that you should discuss. Use the HPLC software (or R if you prefer) to integrate the acetaminophen peak for each sample. Manually record the integration results in your lab notebook Calculate a standard curve using a linear model with a floating intercept. Use units of ppm for your standard curve. Calculate the concentration (in ppm) of the QCs using your standard curve. Calculate the concentration (in ppm) of the samples using your standard curve. Use a t-test to determine if the mass of acetaminophen is significantly different from the expected mass. (See Appendix 3, “Comparing Means”) Plot representative chromatograms: You do not need to export every single chromatogram (your standards should all be very similar, just different in magnitude).

["am-ftir.html", "5.2 FT-IR", " 5.2 FT-IR FT-IR spectroscopy is used to deduce the bonds present in liquids, solids, and gases. It is widely used in industry, research, and teaching for qualitative analysis, but can also provide very accurate quantitative information. All molecules have a unique infrared spectrum, comparable to a person’s fingerprint. However, it is usually very difficult to interpret infrared spectra of mixtures. Chemometrics and linear algebra can circumvent this issue by picking out minute differences between spectra using statistical methods. During this lab, FT-IR will be used to match a sample of acetaminophen to a reference spectrum using a metric called the hit quality index (HQI). This methods provides a measure of how well two spectra match, and a HQI of 0.99 or better is required to indicate a contaminant-free sample. This lab will use the Perkin Elmer Spectrum One FT-IR (Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer) to determine whether samples of Tylenol (acetaminophen) are pure. The Spectrum One is in NS 226. Before lab, read Standardization of Raman Spectra for Transfer of Spectral Libraries Across Different Instruments. Focus on the paragraph regarding hit-quality index calculation. The general order for FT-IR sampling is: (1) collect a background (no sample present) and (2) collect sample spectra by placing a drop of sample on the instrument. You will collect 3 spectra for each sample and 3 spectra of the reference sample. Safety This lab will require the use of small amounts of acetone; avoid contact with skin and eyes. Although samples are over-the-counter products, you should avoid ingesting and/or contacting them with your skin. 5.2.1 Sample Preparation Determine the mass of all contents of your sample vials. Grind your samples into a fine, homogenous powder using a mortar and pestle. Cone a quarter your samples on weighing paper until you have approximately 100 mg of each for FT-IR, and store the extra sample in glass vials. 5.2.2 Instrumentation Choose the CHEM370 user when opening the FTIR software; make sure your spectra are in Absorbance vs. Frequency (wavenumber). Record a background spectrum on the FT-IR according to the FT-IR SOP. Place approximately one-third of the sample on the ATR window and acquire a spectrum. Wet a Kimwipe with a small amount of acetone and clean the ATR cell and anvil with it. Repeat the above steps 2 more times, for a total of three spectra. Repeat the above steps for each sample, for a total of three spectra per sample. Make sure you leave the instrument and your work area clean, and log out of the computer. 5.2.3 Waste Disposal and Cleanup Clean the IR with acetone and replace the cover. Never spray acetone directly on the IR – always spray it on a Kimwipe pointed away from the instrument. Brush up any acetaminophen powder on and around the IR. Use a minimal amount of warm water to rinse any powdered acetaminophen into the bottle labelled “Hazardous Waste: Lab 2 Acetaminophen” that is stored under the sample prep hood in the Instrument Lab. Make sure your work area and the instrument are cleaner than you found them. 5.2.4 Data Processing The following video walks you through the data processing portion of this lab. You should turn a ZIP folder containing: Your complete lab notebook as an .html and .Rmd file functioning with no errors. Your data files. Your completed assessment. You will need to export you data as a CSV file. The Spectrum One does this automatically. Just copy the exported data from the “Spectrum One Data Folder” (there is a shortcut on the desktop) to your folder on NEON. Baseline correct your spectra by subtracting the minimum value from each data point. This should make the minimum value on your plot 0. (See Appendix 2 for R examples) Normalize your spectra by converting from absorbance units to relative absorbance. Your final plot should range from 0 to 1. (See Appendix 2 for R examples) Calculate the Hit Quality Index according to Eq. 2 in Rodriguez et al (2011). Be mindful of the difference between “x” (multiplication) and “·” (dot product).

["am-gcms.html", "5.3 GC-MS", " 5.3 GC-MS Gas chromatography is a technique used to separate mixtures of gases. The gases are injected into a column, which (in our case) is a long, hollow tube with a non-polar liquid coating on the inside. They are pushed through the column with a carrier gas, He in our instrument. The column is initially held at low temperature (a little above room temperature) and ramped at a defined rate up to 250 degrees C. The combination of the temperature ramp and the non-polar column allows compounds to be separated based on boiling point and polarity. GC can be paired with many different techniques, and is often used with electron-ionization mass spectrometry. This type of mass spectrometer breaks molecules apart into fragments, sorts the fragments by mass, and counts the number of fragments of each mass. The specific spectrum (or distribution of fragments) is unique for every chemical compound and is based on the stability of each bond in the molecule. In this way, the identity of a compound can usually be deduced from a mass spectrum alone, although techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy can greatly aid in identification. You will conduct liquid phase microextraction to analyze the volatile constituents of children’s chewable acetaminophen. You should identify the major flavor constituents and comment on whether or not they may be harmful at the approximate levels present. The general order for GC-MS sampling is: (1) run solvent blanks on the GC-MS until the instrument is clean, (2) prepare a single sample using liquid-phase microextraction, (3) run the sample, and (4) repeat 2-4 as necessary. You should obtain a clean blank before preparing your samples. For GC-MS, a passing blank will have a baseline less than 50,000 counts that is stable and peak-free. You may see an increase in the baseline at temperature above 250\\(^{\\circ}\\)C; this is normal and still considered passing. If the blank is dirty you will not be able to tell what is from your sample and what is contamination! This is a qualitative analysis. Safety This lab uses small amounts of methanol (SDS). Methanol can cause blindness and absorbs through the skin. Wear gloves and goggles when working with methanol, and use it in a hood. Microliter syringes may be very sharp! Although samples are over-the-counter products, you should avoid ingesting and/or contacting them with your skin. 5.3.1 Instrumentation Run a solvent blank on the GC-MS using the CHEM370_Acetaminophen.M method. Use a microliter syringe to inject your sample and consult the GC-MS SOP. Checkpoint: A solvent blank in this case is 2 \\(\\mu\\)L methanol and nothing else. Your blank should have a baseline less than 50,000 counts that is stable and free of peaks. If you see peaks, run another blank until you don’t! If your blank is clean, prepare a sample as per below and run on the GC-MS using the CHEM370_Acetaminophen.M method. Consult the GC-MS SOP for more information. 5.3.2 Sample Preparation Grind a Tylenol tablet in a clean mortar and pestle. Cone and quarter your sample until you have about 0.5 g. Place that in an 2-mL GC autosampler vial. Clean a microliter syringe with the syringe cleaning apparatus. Load the syringe with 2 \\(\\mu\\)L of methanol. Place the syringe in an arm clamp/ring stand and push the GC autosampler vial onto the tip of the syringe. Do NOT let the tip touch the powder in vial! Push the plunger of the syringe down all the way so that you have a small drop of methanol on the end of the syringe. The syringe plunger does not go all the way down to the glass body! Do not force it or you will ruin the syringe! Expose the drop of solvent for 30 seconds and then pull the plunger back up to pull the methanol back into the syringe. Inject the sample into the GC immediately. 5.3.3 Data Processing The following videos walk you through the data processing portion of this lab. You should turn a ZIP folder containing: Your complete lab notebook as an .html and .Rmd file functioning with no errors. Your data files. Your completed assessment.

Move the data folder for each sample (ending in .D) to NEON. Transfer the data to your lab notebook folder and complete your analysis of the 2 most abundant compounds in each sample. Plot your chromatogram as Relative Abundance (%) vs. Time (minutes). Plot your mass spectra as Relative Abundance (%) vs. m/z. Clearly identify the base peak, the molecular ion, and any important isotope peaks. Also state how many rings and double bonds your molecule has, and whether it has an odd or even number of nitrogen atoms. Provide a formula, common name, and molecular weight for each compound.

["am-faas.html", "5.5 Flame AA", " 5.5 Flame AA Flame atomic absorption spectroscopy is a common method of determining the concentration of specific metals (cations) in a sample. A solution is nebulized (aerosolized) into an acetylene flame where it is atomized (broken apart into its constituent atoms). The atoms in the flame absorb characteristic wavelengths of light, unique to each element. A light source specific to the analyte of interest (specifically, a hollow cathode lamp) shines through the flame, where the light gets absorbed by the sample. The amount of absorption absorbed is linearly proportional to the concentration of the analyte in solution. Although the instrument is relatively robust and inexpensive, it is limited to probing for a single analyte at a time. The general procedure for this lab is to: (1) grind and dissolve a sample of acetaminophen, (2) prepare standards, blanks, and QCs, (3) run the standards, blank, and QC, and (4) run the samples. For flame AA, the definitions of “passing” are: Blank: Flat, smooth baseline showing only random noise and/or instrument drift no greater than a few percent over 15 minutes. Standard Curve: A linear line with \\(R^2 \\ge 0.9990\\). QC: A measured concentration within 5% (\\(\\pm\\) 5%) of the known concentration. This is a quantitative analysis. Safety Never leave the flame AA unattended when the flame is on. Although samples are over-the-counter products, you should avoid ingesting and/or contacting them with your skin. 5.5.1 Standard Preparation Prepare blanks from ultrapure water. Prepare sodium standards at 1-50 ppm using the stock solution provided. Dilute with ultrapure water using volumetric glassware. Place your standards in 50 mL plastic centrifuge tubes for analysis. 5.5.2 Sample Preparation Tare a clean 50-mL centrifuge tube. Place an acetaminophen tablet in the tube. Obtain the mass of the tablet in the tube. Fill to 50 g with ultrapure water. Place the entire tube in an ultrasonic bath for 5 minutes. Filter the sample into a clean centrifuge tube using a 0.45 \\(\\mu\\)m syringe filter. 5.5.3 Running Samples Use the Flame AA SOP to prepare a flame AA method file containing your blanks and standards. Use the C370_template method as a template. Prepare a Sample Information File containing your QC. Run the blanks, standards, and QC. Checkpoint: A passing blank will show no signs of contamination. A passing standard curve will have \\(R^2 \\ge 0.9990\\). A passing QC will be within \\(\\pm\\) 5% of the known concentration. If any of these is not passing you must repeat the analysis and/or remake your standards until they pass! If everything passes, add your samples to your Sample Information File. Run your newly-added samples. If you have extra sample, try screening it for other metals! (Ask how.) 5.5.4 Waste Disposal and Cleanup Collect all wastes in the Flame AA waste container. Place used (empty) centrifuge tubes in the trash. Wipe up any spilled powder with a paper towel. Remove the vaping machine tubing and rinse it out with ultrapure water. 5.5.5 Data Processing The following video walks you through the data processing portion of this lab.

The examples below assume X is defined as a spectrum containing wavenumber as the first column and absorbance and the second column. Pre-processing Often, IR spectra are normalized for comparison to each other. This is done by baseline correcting the spectra so that the minimum value is zero (i.e. subtracting the minimum value in the spectrum) and setting the maximum value of each spectrum to 1 (i.e. dividing by the maximum value). This approach is shown below. An alternative approach is mean centering, which is not shown here. You should show your normalized data when comparing spectra in your lab notebooks or reports (at least for Chem 370 lab).

The dot product is easily calculated in Octave with the dot() function.

["types-of-error.html", "Types of Error", " Types of Error You will make many mistakes when analyzing your samples, and that’s OK! The important thing is that you can recognize when you’ve made a mistake and figure out how to correct it. Gross Error Gross error occurs when the analyst makes a mistake. For example, you may make your standards too concentrated, dilute a sample incorrectly, or record a value incorrectly in your lab notebook. If only one sample is affected, you can use a Grubb’s test to identify the sample as an outlier and exclude it. If the error affects all your samples, you may need to start over. See Section 22.2 in your textbook for more information. Systematic Error Systematic error occurs when a measurement is systematically high or low, usually the result of instrument drift, improper calibration, or habitual misuse of laboratory glassware (for example, filling to the top of the meniscus instead of the bottom). If your systematic error is big enough you may need to redo your analysis. See Section 22.2 in your textbook for more information. Random Error Random error occurs due to unpredictable (statistically random) fluctuations in instrument response, pipette delivery volumes, balance fluctations, etc. A key factor of random error is that it averages out as the sample size increases. Generally, there is little that can be done to eliminate random error other than increasing the averaging time and/or number of samples. See Section 22.2 in your textbook for more information. "],

You should measure the sample three separate times and report the mean, standard deviation, and relative standard deviation of each measurement.

["limits-of-detection-and-quantitation.html", "Limits of Detection and Quantitation", " Limits of Detection and Quantitation For this course, the Limit of Detection (\\(LOD_y\\)) is defined as 3 times the standard deviation of a blank measurement, \\(y_blank\\), plus the mean value of the blank (\\(\\bar{y}_{blank}\\)). This is the 3\\(\\sigma\\) detection limit and is represented as: \\[ LOD_y = \\bar{y}_{blank} + 3\\sigma_{blank} \\] When a calibration plot (standard curve) is used, this becomes: \\[ LOD_x = \\frac{3\\sigma_{blank}}{m} \\] where \\(m\\) is the slope of the calibration curve and \\(LOD_x\\) is the LOD in the concentration units of the calibration curve. The Limit of Quantitation (\\(LOQ_y\\)) is defined as 10 times the standard deviation of the blank: \\[ LOQ_y = \\bar{y}_{blank} + 10\\sigma_{blank} \\] When a calibration plot (standard curve) is used, this becomes: \\[ LOQ_x = \\frac{10\\sigma_{blank}}{m} \\] "],

["appendix-3-lab-notebook-guidelines.html", "Appendix 3: Lab Notebook Guidelines", " Appendix 3: Lab Notebook Guidelines Your lab notebook is the single exact, permanent, legally defensible, archival record of what you did in lab. In an academic setting, notebooks are often used by the person who wrote the notebook or a lab colleague when trying to repeat an experiment, process data, or publish results. In a professional setting, they may be used to communicate work to new employees, defend against patent lawsuits, or support forensic or toxicological conclusions in a court of law. A good test of your lab notebook is to imagine handing it to a peer who has never completed the lab. Then, try to determine if there would enough information for them to (1) complete the lab with no other resources, (2) exactly repeat your data analysis and calculations and arrive at the exact same answer (including all significant digits), and (3) understand your conclusions and how you arrived at those conclusions. When in doubt, it’s better to include too much than too little! Instrumental analysis presents unique challenges when it comes to keeping lab notebooks. Often, the final data collected is a spectrum or chromatogram with thousands of data points. Instruments save this directly in an electronic format, and archiving it in a paper lab notebook is often unfeasible. To deal with that, this lab uses electronic lab notebooks. You should use your electronic lab notebook exactly as you’ve used paper notebooks in the past – record exactly what you did in lab as you do it (not afterwards!). Include direct observations as necessary. In addition, you will be required to link all data files to your notebook so that your analysis can be exactly repeated and checked for accuracy. In an effort to conduct reproducible data analysis, you will use open-source tools for programmatic data analysis. Your notebook will be kept using RMarkdown and your data will be analyzed directly in your notebook using R. Example Lab Notebooks Good Example Note: data processing in this example was done in the language Julia, not R. Bad Example Note: data processing in this example was done in the language Julia, not R. Bad Example 2 Note: data processing in this example was done in the language Julia, not R. Keeping an Archival Record To maintain an archival record, the lab notebook should: contain an exact record of what you did (past tense); show all procedures and calculations, instrument parameters, and pertinent conclusions and background information; consist of functional code that can be run by another individual with no errors. Writing Your Procedures Write all procedures in past tense. Do not just copy the handout. Good: I added 1.0162 g of acetaminophen to a 200-mL volumetric flask and brought to volume with ultrapure water. Bad: Add 1 g of acetaminophen to 200 mL of water. Explanation: The lab notebook is a record of what you did, not a cookbook. If you were telling a friend about your vacation you wouldn’t say “Get on a plane. Fly to Europe. Go to hotel.”, you would say “I flew from Atlanta to Paris, and then stayed at a hotel in the city center.” Your lab notebook is no different. More importantly, the difference in significant digits is drastic. In the first example, the results will be limited to 5 significant digits by the balance (the balance reports 4 decimal places, or 5 SF in this case, and the volumetric flask contains 200 +/- 0.15 mL); in the second, all that precision has been thrown away and we’re left with a single significant digit. Finally, the second provides no indication as to the purity of the water used, although this is very important for trace instrumental analysis. Include direct observations. Good: Upon collection, I saw that the e-cigarette liquid had turned from clear-yellow to clear-brown after aerosolization. Bad: e-Cigarette liquid was collected. Explanation: The first example includes pertinent observations of exactly what occurred when the step was performed. This helps someone who is doing the lab for the first time know what to expect, and helps you remember what happened when you’re going back through your notes. Importantly, the color change probably indicates a chemical change occured in the sample, which may be worth investigating later. Significant Figures Balances: In general, your significant digits should be limited by the balance. The exact number may depend on which balance you use. Be sure to record all digits on the balance when mass is important, even if they are zeroes; if the last digit fluctuates do the best you can to estimate it. Remember you do NOT have to weigh out the masses exactly as they appear on the worksheet – what matters is that you get close and that you record the actual exact mass you used! Volumetric Glassware: All volumetric pipettes and flasks should be labeled with the volume of water they deliver or contain at room temperature along with the error associated with that volume. Use this to determine your significant digits. Flasks should be used to contain liquid (marked TC) and pipettes should be used to deliver liquid (marked TD); if your pipette has lines for both make sure you use the correct one (TD). Graduated cylinders: For small volumes, these typically have 3 significant digits. You should interpolate to at least the nearest 0.5 mL when using a graduated cylinder. Again, there is a large difference between recording 10 ml and 10.5 ml in your notebook in regards to significant figures (1 vs 3)! Most work in instrumental analysis should use volumetric glassware and not graduated cylinders. Beakers/Erlenmeyer Flasks: These should not be used to measure volumes in instrumental analysis.. Creating Instrument Tables You are expected to provide a table of all relevant instrument information in your lab notebook for each instrument you use. There is no specific formula for creating these – the information you need depends on the instrument. The best way to learn what to include is to look at examples, a few of which are linked below. You will need to look in the instrument method (in the software) and sometimes on the physical instrument itself to find the information you need. If you’re weary about opening an instrument up to look, please ask for help!

An example of a UV-vis block diagram is shown below. Notice that the main parts of the instrument are clearly shown with a labels. Colors, shapes, images, and line thickness are used to convey information as well. For example, the filter wheel selects green light from the broad-spectrum source so the light path is shown in green after that point. Likewise, the beam splitter sends a fraction of the beam through the reference cell and the rest to the sample; thus, the line width is varied to show this. There is no specific formula for creating a block diagram – your goal is to clearly, but succinctly, convey the key components and operating principle behind the instrument. The best way to learn how to make one is to look at examples. Your textbook has examples for most (if not all) the instruments it covers, and there are innumerable examples online on the websites of instrument manufacturers, in scientific papers, and in online encyclopedias. Take a look around and get some ideas, and then make your own. (And don’t just copy one you found!) Need help making the diagram or getting it into your notebook?
